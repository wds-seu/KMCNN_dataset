analysis showed that this protein has Asp box and FRIP domains , it was predicted to have an extracellular localization , and a mass of 42 kDa , all of which are characteristics of sialidases Structural modeling predicted a canonical 6-bladed beta-propeller structure with the model 's highly conserved catalytic residues aligning well with those of an experimentally determined sialidase structure The gene encoding the putative Af sialidase was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli Enzymatic characterization found that the enzyme was able to cleave the synthetic sialic acid substrate , 4-methylumbelliferyl alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid \( MUN \) , and had a pH optimum of 3 5 Further kinetic characterization using 4-methylumbelliferyl alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminylgalactopyranoside revealed that Af sialidase preferred alpha2-3-linked sialic acids over the alpha2-6 isomers No trans-sialidase activity was detected qPCR studies showed that exposure to MEM plus human serum induced expression Purified Af sialidase released sialic acid from diverse substrates such as mucin , fetuin , epithelial cell glycans and colominic acid , though A fumigatus was unable to use either sialic acid or colominic acid as a sole source of carbon Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the fungal sialidases were more closely related to those of bacteria than to sialidases from other eukaryotes",G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0009013|G0000000|C1880022|G0000000|G0000000|C0027803|G0000000|G0000000|C1979891|C0016832|G0000000|C0004034|C0004037|G0000000|C0017337|C1547699|G0000000|G0000000|C0027803|G0000000|C0205396|G0000000|G0000000|C0017428|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0016832|C0450254|G0000000|C0004034|C0004037|C1516769|C0002778|C1547282|G0000000|G0000000|C0033684|G0000000|C0206293|C0179400|G0000000|G0000000|C1880389|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0681842|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0521119|C0475264|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0577559|G0000000|C0450371|C1532717|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1521970|G0000000|C0027803|C0678594|C0870071|C0681842|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0330390|C0678594|G0000000|G0000000|C3161035|C0565930|C0205250|G0000000|C0007382|C1709915|C2369992|C0205170|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0027803|C0678594|G0000000|C0017337|C1547699|G0000000|G0000000|C0344434|C0027803|G0000000|C0009013|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0014833|G0000000|C0014442|C1880022|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C0085732|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C1883254|C0036087|C0001128|C1710236|G0000000|G0000000|C0439095|C0001128|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450407|C2698651|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1517331|C0022702|C1880022|C1524063|G0000000|C0439095|C0443289|G0000000|C0344434|C0027803|C0558295|C0241764|C0036087|C0001128|C0205136|G0000000|G0000000|C0022203|G0000000|C1101145|C0205177|G0000000|C0442726|C1709846|C0947630|C1547282|G0000000|C0274281|C0040363|G0000000|C0332287|C0086418|C0229671|C0205263|C0185117|C1998793|C0344434|C0027803|C0391871|C0036087|C0001128|G0000000|C1880371|C1710236|G0000000|G0000000|C0026682|G0000000|C0002210|G0000000|C0221908|C0007634|C0032594|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0004037|G0000000|C1299582|C0040363|C0042153|C3844638|C0036087|C0001128|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|G0000000|C0230463|C0449416|G0000000|C0007009|C0031797|C0002778|C0443289|G0000000|G0000000|C0016832|C0027803|G0000000|C0205172|G0000000|C0439849|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0004611|G0000000|C0040363|C0027803|G0000000|G0000000|C0684063

"22575895 20120512 Microbiology \( Reading , Engl \) D016428 D013485 Biochemical characterization of Aspergillus niger CfcI , a glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinase that releases monomers during substrate hydrolysis The genome of the industrially important fungus Aspergillus niger encodes a large number of glycoside hydrolase family 18 members annotated as chitinases We identified one of these putative chitinases , CfcI , as a representative of a distinct phylogenetic clade of homologous enzymes conserved in all sequenced Aspergillus species Where the catalytic domain of more distantly related chitinases consists of a triosephosphate isomerase barrel in which a small additional \( \) domain is inserted , CfcI-like proteins were found to have , in addition , a carbohydrate-binding module \( CBM18 \) that is inserted in the \( \) domain next to the substrate-binding cleft This unusual domain structure and sequence dissimilarity to previously characterized chitinases suggest that CfcI has a novel activity or function different from chitinases investigated so far Following its heterologous expression and purification , its biochemical characterization

characterization of Aspergillus niger CfcI , a glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinase that releases monomers during substrate hydrolysis The genome of the industrially important fungus Aspergillus niger encodes a large number of glycoside hydrolase family 18 members annotated as chitinases We identified one of these putative chitinases , CfcI , as a representative of a distinct phylogenetic clade of homologous enzymes conserved in all sequenced Aspergillus species Where the catalytic domain of more distantly related chitinases consists of a triosephosphate isomerase barrel in which a small additional \( \) domain is inserted , CfcI-like proteins were found to have , in addition , a carbohydrate-binding module \( CBM18 \) that is inserted in the \( \) domain next to the substrate-binding cleft This unusual domain structure and sequence dissimilarity to previously characterized chitinases suggest that CfcI has a novel activity or function different from chitinases investigated so far Following its heterologous expression and purification , its biochemical characterization showed that CfcI displays optimal activity at pH 4 and 55-65 C and degrades chitin oligosaccharides by releasing N-acetylglucosamine from the reducing end , possibly via a processive mechanism This is the first fungal family 18 exochitinase described , to our knowledge , that exclusively releases monomers The cfcI expression profile suggests that its physiological function is important in processes that take place during the late stages of the aspergillus life cycle , such

gloeosporioides cutinase gene as a heterologous probe the nucleotide sequence of a 2 kb DNA segment containing the gene has been determined DNA hybridization analysis shows that the M grisea genome contains only one copy of this gene The predicted polypeptide contains 228 amino acids and is homologous to the three previously characterized cutinases , showing 74 amino acid similarity to the cutinase of C gloeosporioides Comparison with previously determined cutinase sequences suggests that the gene contains two introns , 115 and 147 bp in length The gene is expressed when cutin is the sole carbon source but not when the carbon source is cutin and glucose together or glucose alone Levels of intracellular and extracellular cutinase activity increase in response to growth in the presence of cutin The activity level is higher in a transformant containing multiple copies of the cloned gene than in the parent strain Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels stained for esterase activity show a single major band among intracellular and extracellular proteins from cutin-grown cultures that is not present among intracellular and extracellular proteins prepared from

activity increase in response to growth in the presence of cutin The activity level is higher in a transformant containing multiple copies of the cloned gene than in the parent strain Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels stained for esterase activity show a single major band among intracellular and extracellular proteins from cutin-grown cultures that is not present among intracellular and extracellular proteins prepared from glucose-grown or carbon-starved cultures This band stains more intensely in extracts from the multicopy transformant than in extracts from the parent strain We conclude that the cloned DNA contains a M grisea gene for cutinase , which we have named

more active \( two- to fourfold \) in hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose \( Avicel \) at 45 degrees C than T reesei Cel7A The C thermophilum Cel7A showed the highest specific activity and temperature optimum when measured on soluble substrates The most effective enzyme for Avicel hydrolysis at 70 degrees C , however , was the 2-module version of the T aurantiacus Cel7A , which was also relatively weakly inhibited by cellobiose These results are discussed from the structural point of view based on the three-dimensional homology models of these enzymes",G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0009013|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|C1880022|G0000000|C0205314|C0597571|C0015576|G0000000|C0059939|G0000000|C0449719|G0000000|G0000000|C0015264|C0040363|C0243095|C0332272|C1260229|G0000000|G0000000|C0033268|C1184743|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0233426|G0000000|C0205314|C0033993|C0015576|C0059939|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|C0032521|C1710236|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0871208|C1261552|G0000000|G0000000|C0020291|G0000000|C0007648|G0000000|C0014442|C0871161|G0000000|C0557651|G0000000|G0000000|C0684224|G0000000|G0000000|C0015576|G0000000|C0059939|G0000000|G0000000|C0597570|C0016832|C0001180|G0000000|G0000000|C0997442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007929|G0000000|G0000000|C0040914|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C1273517|G0000000|G0000000|C1514811|G0000000|G0000000|C0681814|G0000000|G0000000|C0302891|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1148582|C1709061|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1514798|C0033684|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3844638|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2827421|G0000000|G0000000|C0205314|C0001128|C0059939|G0000000|C0205172|C0597571|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205172|C0205177|G0000000|C0205448|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0020291|G0000000|C3255829|C0007648|G0000000|C0733543|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1547282|G0000000|C1522410|C0205369|C0205177|G0000000|C0005903|C2698651|G0000000|C0444706|G0000000|C1749467|C1710236|G0000000|C0205393|C1280519|C0014442|G0000000|C0733543|C0020291|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1709061|C0333052|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0311403|G0000000|C0007630|G0000000|C1274040|G0000000|C2584313|G0000000|G0000000|C0678594|C1552961|G0000000|C0449911|C1527178|G0000000|G0000000|C0450363|C1334043|C3161035|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442

50 488 kDa The gene product expressed in E coli as a recombinant protein fused with thioredoxin and His \( 6 \) tags had almost the same substrate specificity and mode of action as native enzyme purified from a commercial cellulase preparation of T viride , i e recombinant enzyme endo-hydrolysed beta- \( 1-- 6 \) -galacto-oligomers with a DP \( degree of polymerization \) higher than 3 , and it could also hydrolyse alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase-treated arabinogalactan protein from radish It produced beta- \( 1-- 6 \) -galacto-oligomers ranging from DP 2 to at least 8 at the initial hydrolysis stage and galactose and beta- \( 1-- 6 \) -galactobiose as the major products at the final reaction stage These results indicate that the cloned gene encodes an endo-beta- \( 1-- 6 \)
