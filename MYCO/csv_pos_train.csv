at proximity of the peak activity The production of MnPs varied in different organisms but was clearly regulated by inducing liquid media components \( Mn2 , veratryl alcohol and malonate \) In total 8 different MnP isoforms were purified Results of this study reinforce the conception that MnPs from distinct organisms differ substantially in their properties Production of the extracellular enzyme in general did not reach a substantial level This further suggests that these native producers are not suitable for industrial scale production of the enzyme The highest specific activities were

plant \( Lycopersicon esculentum \) is proposed to protect the plant against phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum f sp lycopersici , a vascular pathogen of tomato , produces a tomatinase enzyme which hydrolyses the glycoalkaloid into non-fungitoxic compounds Detoxification of alpha-tomatine may be how this fungus avoids the plant glycoalkaloid barrier As an initial step to evaluate this possibility we have studied the induction of tomatinase \( i \) in fungal cultures containing extracts from leaf , stem or root of tomato plants and \( ii \) in stem and root of tomato plants infected with the pathogen at different infection stages The kinetics of tomatinase induction with leaf extract \( 0 6 dry weight \) was similar to that observed with 20 micrograms ml-1 of alpha-tomatine In the presence of stem extract , tomatinase activity was less than 50 of that induced with leaf extract , whereas in the presence of root extract tomatinase activity was very low In the stem of infected tomato plants tomatinase activity was higher at the wilt stage than in previous infections stages and in root , tomatinase activity appeared with the first symptoms and was maintained until wilting TLC analysis showed that the tomatinase induced in culture medium with plant extracts and in infected tomato plants had the same mode of action as the enzyme induced with pure alpha-tomatine ,

active extracellular proteins Optimal PGC2 activity was observed at 50 C and pH 5 The Km and Vmax values of purified r-FOC1-PGC2 were 0 43 mg mL \( -1 \) and 94 34 units mg protein \( -1 \) min \( -1 \) , respectively The Km and Vmax values of purified r-FOC4-PGC2 were 0 48 mg mL \( -1 \) and 95 24 units mg protein \( -1 \) min \( -1 \) , respectively Both recombinant PGC2 proteins could induce tissue maceration and necrosis in banana plants Collectively , these results suggest that PGC2 is the first exoPG reported from the pathogen FOC , and we have shown that fully functional PGC2 can be produced in the P pastoris expression

"23268348 20121227 Gene D016428 D013485 Cloning , characterization and heterelogous expression of the INU1 gene from Cryptococcus aureus HYA The INU1 gene \( Accession number JX073660 \) encoding exo-inulinase from Cryptococcus aureus HYA was cloned and characterized The gene had an open reading frame \( ORF \) of 1653 bp long encoding an inulinase The coding region of the gene was not interrupted by any intron It encoded 551 amino acid residues of a protein with a putative signal peptide of 23 amino acids and the calculated molecular mass of 59 5 kDa The protein sequence deduced from the inulinase structural gene contained the inulinase consensus sequences \( WMNDPNGL \) , \( RDP \) , ECP , FS and Q It also had two conserved putative N-glycosylation sites The inulinase from C aureus HYA was found to be closely related to that from Kluyveromyces marxianus and Pichia guilliermondii The inulinase gene without the signal sequence was subcloned into pPICZaA expression vector and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 The expressed fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting and a specific band with molecular mass of about 60 kDa was found Enzyme activity assay verified the recombinant protein as an inulinase A maximum inulinase activity of 16 3 0 24 U ml was obtained from the culture supernatant of P pastoris X-33 harboring the inulinase gene The optimal temperature and pH for action of the enzyme were 50 C and 5 0 , respectively A large amount of monosaccharides were detected after the hydrolysis of inulin with the purified recombinant inulinase","23268348 20121227 Gene D016428 D013485 Cloning , characterization and heterelogous expression of the INU1 gene from Cryptococcus aureus HYA The INU1 gene \( Accession number JX073660 \)

"8065265 19940501 Mol Microbiol D016428 Regulation of the xylanase-encoding xlnA gene of Aspergillus tubigensis A gene encoding an endo-1 , 4-beta-xylanase from Aspergillus tubigensis was cloned by oligonucleotide screening using oligonucleotides derived from amino acid sequence data obtained from the purified protein The isolated gene was functional as it could be expressed in the very closely related fungus Aspergillus niger The xylanase encoded by this gene is synthesized as a protein of 211 amino acids After cleavage of the presumed prepropeptide this results in a mature protein of 184 amino acids with a molecular weight of 19 kDa and an isoelectric point of 3 6 The regulatory region of the xlnA gene was studied with respect to the response to xylan induction and carbon catabolite repression By deletion analysis of the 5' upstream region of the gene a 158 bp region involved in the xylan specific induction was identified To study this regulatory element a reporter system for transcriptional activating sequences was developed that is based on the A niger glucose oxidase-encoding gene From the results with this reporter system it is concluded that this 158 bp fragment not only contains the information required for induction of transcription but that it also plays a role in carbon catabolite repression of the xlnA gene The region directly upstream of this fragment contains four potential CREA target sites deletion of this region leads to an increase in the level of transcription These results suggest that carbon catabolite repression of the xlnA gene is controlled at two levels , directly by repression of xlnA gene transcription and indirectly by repression of the expression of a transcriptional activator This type of mechanism would be similar to

three aspergilli","8065265 19940501 Mol Microbiol D016428 Regulation of the xylanase-encoding xlnA gene of Aspergillus tubigensis A gene encoding an endo-1 , 4-beta-xylanase from Aspergillus tubigensis was cloned by oligonucleotide screening using oligonucleotides derived from amino acid sequence data obtained from the purified protein The isolated gene was functional as it could be expressed in the very closely related fungus Aspergillus niger The xylanase encoded by this gene is synthesized as a protein of 211 amino acids After cleavage of the presumed prepropeptide this results in a mature protein of 184 amino acids with a molecular weight of 19 kDa and an isoelectric point of 3 6 The regulatory region of the xlnA gene was studied with respect to the response to xylan induction and carbon catabolite repression By deletion analysis of the 5' upstream region of the gene a 158 bp region involved in the xylan specific induction was identified To study this regulatory element a reporter system for transcriptional activating sequences was developed that is based on the A niger glucose oxidase-encoding gene From the results with this reporter system it is concluded that this 158 bp fragment not only contains the information required for induction of transcription but that it also plays a role in carbon catabolite repression of the xlnA gene The region directly upstream of this fragment contains four potential CREA target sites deletion of this region leads to an increase in the level of transcription These results suggest that carbon catabolite repression of the xlnA gene is controlled at two levels , directly by repression of xlnA gene transcription and indirectly by repression of the expression of a transcriptional activator This type of mechanism would be similar to the double lock mechanism for the regulation of gene expression of alcA in Aspergillus nidulans The reporter system was also used to study the regulation of expression via the functions located on this fragment in A niger and in A nidulans Essentially the same pattern of regulation was found in both of these hosts Therefore , regulation of xylanase gene expression

of the reaction products of hydrolysis of a mixture of pectate lyase-generated delta 4 , 5-unsaturated oligogalacturonates of degree of polymerization 4-8 Whereas endopolygalacturonase I showed a strong preference for generating the delta 4 , 5-unsaturated dimer , with endopolygalacturonase II the delta 4 , 5-unsaturated trimer accumulated , indicating further differences in substrate specificity For endopolygalacturonases C and E both the delta 4 , 5-unsaturated dimer and trimer were observed , although in different

\) , was expressed in Escherichia coli as a thioredoxin fusion protein and was purified to homogeneity EstA' was active against synthetic and plant cell-wall-derived substrates , showed a marked preference for cleaving 1-- 5 ester linkages between ferulic acid and arabinose in feruloylated arabino-xylo-oligosaccharides and was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor aminoethylbenzene-sulphonylfluoride EstA' acted synergistically with xylanase to release more than 60 of the esterified ferulic acid from the arabinoxylan component of plant cell walls Western analysis confirmed that EstA is produced by P equi and is a component of the aggregated multienzyme cellulase-hemicellulase complex Hybrid proteins , harbouring one , two or three iterations of the conserved 40-residue fungal docking domain fused to the reporter protein glutathione S-transferase , were produced Western blot analysis of immobilized P equi cellulase-hemicellulase complex demonstrated that each of the hybrid proteins bound to a 97 kDa polypeptide in the extracellular

complexes , similar to the dockerin of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum The difference in domain structures indicated that the two highly similar esterases of Orpinomyces and Neocallimastix may be differently located , the former being a free enzyme and the latter being a component of a cellulase-hemicellulase complex Sequence data indicate that AxeA and BnaA might represent a new family of hydrolases",G0000000|G0000000|C1858559|C1568941|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1880022|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0014894|G0000000|G0000000|C3641081|C0016832|C0600473|C0037747|C0080194|C0031995|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|C0006556|G0000000|C1524084|G0000000|G0000000|C0009219|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0014894|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0009013|G0000000|G0000000|C3641081|C0035946|C0016832|C0600473|C0037747|C0080194|C0031995|G0000000|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|C0175566|C0034754|C0080089|G0000000|C1442061|C0037623|C1547699|G0000000|C1305923|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|C0001128|C1709915|G0000000|G0000000|C0444686|C0577559|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|C1442061|C0011318|G0000000|C0205177|C0014894|C1524063|G0000000|C0205313|C0439659|C0009221|G0000000|G0000000|C0006556|G0000000|C1883254|G0000000|C0014833|G0000000|C0205448|C0205177|C0348078|G0000000|G0000000|C0014894|G0000000|C1998793|G0000000|C1514798|G0000000|G0000000|C0010453|G0000000|C0456389|C1705241|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|G0000000|C1274040|G0000000|C0010813|G0000000|C0205448|C1705242|C0205145|G0000000|G0000000|C1710082|C0030956|G0000000|C0014442|C0391871|C0000975|G0000000|C0439064|G0000000|C1710236|G0000000|C0332257|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205174|G0000000|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|C1514798|C0059100|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0445247|C0016832|C1524063|C0369773|C0000975|G0000000|G0000000|C1710236|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|C0597277|G0000000|C0369637|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|C0439194|C0702093|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0026410|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0005903|G0000000|C0450407|C2698651|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|C0001128|C0424215|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0014894|G0000000|C0600478|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0600473|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205341|C0030956|C1880389|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0596260|C0205088|G0000000|G0000000|C0600478|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0020289|G0000000|C0014894|G0000000|C3641081|C0016832|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|C0031843|G0000000|G0000000|C0442632|C1880389|G0000000|C0007641|C1704241|G0000000|C2348205|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1257924|G0000000|C0009054|G0000000|G0000000|C1705241|G0000000|C1880389|C0678594|C1444656|G0000000|G0000000|C0205448|C0205250|C2348205|C0014894|G0000000|C0600473|G0000000|C0600478|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205156|G0000000|G0000000|C0332296|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0449432|G0000000|G0000000|C0007641|C0439855|C0004793|C1511726|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1882932|G0000000|C0205314|C0015576|G0000000|C0020289

Endoglucanase is a major cellulolytic enzyme produced by Syncephalastrum racemosum \( BCC18080 \) Preliminary results showed that this endoglucanase is thermotolerant as it retained more than 50 of its activity after incubation at 80 degrees C for an hour As this property may be of industrial use , we have cloned the full-length BCC18080 endoglucanase gene of 1020 nucleotides Sequence analysis suggested that it belonged to the glycosyl hydrolase family 45 N-terminal sequencing and analysis by SignalP program suggested that the first 32 amino acid residues encoded the signal peptide Expression of the recombinant clones with and without its own signal peptide in Pichia pastoris demonstrated that P pastoris produced active 55 and 30 kDa secreted proteins N-terminal sequencing suggested that the 55 kDa band was the mature protein while the 30 kDa band was the truncated protein Glycoprotein analysis showed that the 55 kDa protein was glycosylated while the smaller protein was not All recombinant endoglucanases showed optimal temperature of 70 degrees C and optimal pH of 5-6 They retained more than 50 activity for 4h at 70 degrees C In addition , high k \( cat \) and

in the hosts Escherichia coli , Pichia pastoris , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Expression was initially performed in E coli using either the lacZ or tac promoter This resulted in intracellular expression of the BglB protein with the protein being rapidly fragmented Secretion and glycosylation of active beta-glucosidase was achieved with several different S cerevisiae constructs utilizing either the adh1 or the gal1 promoter on 2-micro replicating plasmids When either the invertase \( Suc2 \) or the BglB secretion signal was used , BglB protein remained associated with the cell wall and appeared to be hyperglycosylated Expression in P pastoris was also examined to determine if higher activity and expression could be achieved in a yeast host that usually does not hyperglycosylate Using the alcohol oxidase promoter in conjunction with either the pho1 or the alpha-factor secretion signal , the recombinant enzyme was successfully secreted and glycosylated in P pastoris However , levels of protein expression from the chromosomally integrated vector were insufficient to detect activity",G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0325074|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|C0036536|G0000000|G0000000|C0006836|G0000000|C0521119|C0005223|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0036024|G0000000|G0000000|C0036025|C0006836|G0000000|C0699789|G0000000|C0007634|C0005223|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|C0007630|G0000000|G0000000|C1749467|C0108983|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1710548|C0085732|C0040363|G0000000|C0444930|C0021467|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0017337|G0000000|C2700640|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|C0009013|G0000000|C0004793|G0000000|G0000000|C0022877|C1524063|C0439064|C1705242|C0086860|G0000000|C2827421|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1167395|C0014833|G0000000|G0000000|C0031874|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0036024|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|C0205265|C0884358|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1524063|C3844638|G0000000|C0022959|G0000000|C1883257|C0086860|G0000000|C1274040|G0000000|C0175996|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0033684|G0000000|G0000000|C0033684|G0000000|C0456962|C0332472|C0036536|G0000000|C0017982|G0000000|C0205177|C0005223|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439064|C1705242|C0565930|G0000000|C2827421|G0000000|C3844638|G0000000|C1412239|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0086860|G0000000|C0085672|C0205173|C0032136|G0000000|C3844638|G0000000|C0053409|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0036536|C1710082|G0000000|C1273517|G0000000|G0000000|C0033684|G0000000|C0332281|G0000000|G0000000|C0007634|C0677535|G0000000|C0700364|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|C0369773|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0332128|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0205250|C0205177|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0036025|C1167395|G0000000|C3538928|G0000000|C1518422|G0000000|C1524063|G0000000|C0001962|C0242417|C0086860|G0000000|C2699427|G0000000|C3844638|G0000000|C0768581|G0000000|G0000000|C0439095|C0036536|C1710082|G0000000|G0000000|C1514798|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|C1327616|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0369773|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0441889|G0000000|C0033684|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0086022|G0000000|C0205412|C0040363|C0442726|C0205177

\( RNA \) analysis reveals a unique SSG1-specific transcript , 1 7 kb long , which can be detected only in sporulating diploids \( MATa MAT alpha \) but does not appear in vegetatively growing cells or in nonsporulating diploids \( MAT alpha MAT alpha \) when incubated under nitrogen starvation conditions The meiotic time course of SSG1 induction indicates that the gene is transcribed only in the late stages of the process , beginning at the time of meiosis I and reaching a maximum during spore formation Homozygous ssg1 ssg1 mutant diploids are able to complete sporulation , although with a significant delay in the appearance of mature

in pH 2 0-5 0 Western blot analysis using anit-XynA antibody showed that XynA was induced by xylan and repressed by glucose Also , its production was increased by an acidic medium The gene encoding XynA \( xynA \) was isolated from the genomic library of Penicillium sp 40 The structural part of xynA was found to be 721 bp The nucleotide sequence of cDNA amplified by RT-PCR showed that the open reading frame of xynA was interrupted by a single intron which was 58 bp in size and encoded 221 amino acids Direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the precursor of XynA had a signal peptide composed of 31 amino acids The molecular mass caliculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of XynA is 20 , 713 This is lower than that estimated by gel electrophoresis , suggesting that XynA is a glycoprotein The predicted amino acid sequence of XynA has strong similarity to other family xylanases from

quite different from each other In particular , cellobiose was hydrolyzed more effectively by BGL1B than by BGL1A The expression of the two genes in the fungus was monitored by reverse transcription-PCR , which showed that bgl1A was expressed constitutively in both glucose- and cellobiose-containing culture , whereas bgl1B was expressed in cellobiose culture but was repressed in

base pairs \( bp \) \( bgl1A \) and 1 , 623 bp \( bgl1B \) , encoding 462 and 530 amino acids , respectively Although high sequence identity \( 65 \) was observed between the deduced amino acid sequences of the two enzymes , an apparent difference was observed at the C-terminal region BGL1B has a 63-amino acid extension , which has no similarity with any known protein Both recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli showed hydrolytic activity towards several beta-glycosidic compounds However , the substrate recognition patterns of the two enzymes were quite different from each other In particular , cellobiose was hydrolyzed more effectively by BGL1B than by BGL1A The expression of the two genes in the fungus was monitored by reverse transcription-PCR , which showed that bgl1A was expressed constitutively in both glucose- and cellobiose-containing culture , whereas bgl1B was expressed in cellobiose culture but was repressed in glucose culture , possibly because of carbon catabolite repression We conclude that BGL1B contributes to cellobiose metabolism during cellulose degradation by P

"15716038 20050218 Biochim Biophys Acta D016428 Mutational analysis of a feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus awamori involved in substrate discrimination and pH dependence We cloned the feruloyl esterase A gene from Aspergillus awamori \( AwfaeA \) and engineered it to study substrate specificity and pH dependence of catalysis Based on the crystal structures of two type-A feruloyl esterases \( FAE-III and AnFAEA \) from Aspergillus niger , residues located in the flap region of AwFAEA \( Asp71 , Thr72 , Asp77 , and Tyr80 \) were replaced with corresponding amino acid residues \( Ile , Arg , Asn , and Phe \) , respectively , found in the lid of lipases from Rhizomucor miehei \( RmLIP \) and Humicola lanuginose \( HlLIP \) Furthermore , Asp77 of AwFAEA , which is conserved in Aspergillus FAEs and lipases , was replaced with a hydrophobic residue \( Ile \) Kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes showed that the higher catalytic efficiency of the D77I and Y80F mutants toward alpha-naphthylbutyrate \( C4 \) and alpha-naphthylcaprylate \( C8 \) , respectively , was due to a lower K \( m \) value The higher catalytic efficiency of D77N toward C4 substrate was due to a combination of decreased K \( m \) and considerably increased k \( cat \) The D71I and Y80F mutants showed some activity toward long-acyl chain esters On the other hand , the D77I mutant had no detectable activity toward phenolic acid methyl esters and feruloylated arabinoxylan Moreover , the pH optima of the D77I , D77N , and Y80F mutants increased from 5 0 to 7 0-8 0 , 7 0 , and 6 0 ,

common with other family 3 glycosidases , this enzyme hydrolyzes with net retention of anomeric configuration Accordingly , the enzyme was inactivated by 2-deoxy-2-fluoro beta-glucosyl fluoride , with kinetic parameters of k \( i \) 4 5 min \( -1 \) , K \( I \) 35 4 mM , through the trapping of a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate The catalytic competence of this intermediate was demonstrated by the fact that incubation with linamarin resulted in reactivation , presumably via a transglycosylation mechanism Peptic digestion of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl enzyme and subsequent analysis of high pressure liquid chromatography eluates by electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in the neutral loss mode allowed the localization of a 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl-peptide Sequence determination of this labeled peptide by tandem mass spectrometry in the daughter ion scan mode permitted the identification of Asp-261 as the catalytic nucleophile within the sequence VMSDW Asp-261 is fully conserved within this family , consistent with its key role , and aligns with the aspartic acid residue previously identified in the Aspergillus wentii enzyme by labeling with conduritol B

"18548669 19830201 Biotechnol Bioeng D016428 Characterization of cellobiose fermentations to ethanol by yeasts Twenty-two different yeasts were screened for their ability to ferment both glucose and cellobiose The fermentation characteristics of Candida lusitaniae \( NRRL Y-5394 \) and C wickerhamii \( NRRL Y-2563 \) were selected for further study because their initial rate of ethanol production from cellobiose was faster than the other test cultures C lusitaniae produced 44 g L ethanol from 90 g L cellobiose after 5-7 days When higher carbohydrate concentrations were employed , fermentation ceased when the ethanol concentration reached 45-60 g L C lusitaniae exhibited barely detectable levels of beta-glucosidase , even though the culture actively fermented cellobiose C wickerhamii produced ethanol from cellobiose at a rate equivalent to C lusitaniae however , once the ethanol concentration reached 20 g L , fermentation ceased Using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside \( pNPG \) as substrate , beta-glucosidase \( 3-5 U mL \) was detected when C wickerhamii was grown anaerobically on glucose or cellobiose About 35 of the beta-glucosidase activity was excreted into the

ability to ferment both glucose and cellobiose The fermentation characteristics of Candida lusitaniae \( NRRL Y-5394 \) and C wickerhamii \( NRRL Y-2563 \) were selected for further study because their initial rate of ethanol production from cellobiose was faster than the other test cultures C lusitaniae produced 44 g L ethanol from 90 g L cellobiose after 5-7 days When higher carbohydrate concentrations were employed , fermentation ceased when the ethanol concentration reached 45-60 g L C lusitaniae exhibited barely detectable levels of beta-glucosidase , even though the culture actively fermented cellobiose C wickerhamii produced ethanol from cellobiose at a rate equivalent to C lusitaniae however , once the ethanol concentration reached 20 g L , fermentation ceased Using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside \( pNPG \) as substrate , beta-glucosidase \( 3-5 U mL \) was detected when C wickerhamii was grown anaerobically on glucose or cellobiose About 35 of the beta-glucosidase activity was excreted into the medium The cell-associated activity was highest against pNPG and salicin Approximately 100-fold less activity was detected with cellobiose as substrate

"11357511 20010519 Arch Microbiol D016428 D013485 Expression of Pichia anomala INV1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in two different active forms of hypoglycosylated invertase The Pichia anomala invertase gene \( INV1 \) was introduced at different copy numbers into a sucrose-nonfermenting mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and expressed from its own promoter sequences The level reached in the production of invertase by the transformants \( up to 540 units 10 \( 10 \) cells \) was in agreement with the INV1 gene dosage Two forms of multimeric active and glycosylated invertase displaying different subcellular locations and molecular masses could be detected in the transformants One was found to be present in the culture medium and in the periplasm , and the other could only be detected inside the cell Each of the two heterologous forms of invertase was shown to be an oligomer composed of identical subunits The difference found in the apparent molecular masses of their monomers \( 81 5 and 78 3 kDa , respectively \) seems to be due to the size of their N-linked oligosaccharide chains \( on average 2 4 and 1 9 kDa , respectively \) , since the number of sugar chains \( 9 \) and the molecular mass of the protein moiety \( 60 5 kDa \) are identical in both forms The shorter size of their oligosaccharides must also be the reason for the lower apparent molecular masses of the heterologous invertases when compared with the enzyme purified from P anomala The hypoglycosylated invertase accumulated within the cells of the transformants to an unusual level \( up

two different active forms of hypoglycosylated invertase The Pichia anomala invertase gene \( INV1 \) was introduced at different copy numbers into a sucrose-nonfermenting mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and expressed from its own promoter sequences The level reached in the production of invertase by the transformants \( up to 540 units 10 \( 10 \) cells \) was in agreement with the INV1 gene dosage Two forms of multimeric active and glycosylated invertase displaying different subcellular locations and molecular masses could be detected in the transformants One was found to be present in the culture medium and in the periplasm , and the other could only be detected inside the cell Each of the two heterologous forms of invertase was shown to be an oligomer composed of identical subunits The difference found in the apparent molecular masses of their monomers \( 81 5 and 78 3 kDa , respectively \) seems to be due to the size of their N-linked oligosaccharide chains \( on

infiltration of broad bean leaves The amino acid \( aa \) D192A substitution in the active site of BcPG2 not only abolished enzyme activity but also the NA , indicating that the NA is dependent on enzyme activity Furthermore , deletion of the Bcpg2 gene in B cinerea resulted in a strong reduction in virulence on tomato and broad bean Primary lesion formation was delayed by approximately 24 h

endopolygalacturonases , they apparently have different modes of action PGA hydrolysis by BcPG1 , BcPG2 and BcPG4 leads to the transient accumulation of oligomers with DP 7 , whereas PGA hydrolysis by BcPG3 and BcPG6 leads to the immediate accumulation of monomers and dimers The necrotizing activity \( NA \) of all BcPGs was tested separately in tomato , broad bean and Arabidopsis thaliana They showed different NAs on these plants BcPG1 and BcPG2 possessed the strongest NA as tissue collapse was observed within 10 min after infiltration of broad bean leaves The amino acid \( aa \) D192A substitution in the active site of BcPG2 not only abolished enzyme activity but also the NA , indicating that the NA is dependent on enzyme activity Furthermore , deletion of the Bcpg2 gene in B cinerea resulted in a strong reduction in virulence on tomato and broad bean Primary lesion formation was delayed by approximately 24 h and the lesion expansion rate was reduced by 50-85 These data indicate that BcPG2 is an important virulence factor for B cinerea",G0000000|G0000000|C0032098|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439664|C0205177|G0000000|C0205451|C0006040|G0000000|C0014240|G0000000|G0000000|C0031874|G0000000|C0205451|C0006040|G0000000|C0014240|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0031874|G0000000|G0000000|C1998793|C0040363|C1881065|G0000000|G0000000|C1880022|G0000000|G0000000|C0450407|C2698651|G0000000|G0000000|C0205451|C0014442|G0000000|C2348205|G0000000|C0332232|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0806909|C0205177|G0000000|C0027361|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0020291|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|C3541266|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1514721|G0000000|C0450371|C0040363|C1442061|G0000000|C0026410|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0597277|G0000000|C0369637|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1514721|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0026410|C0439526|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205238|C0014240|G0000000|G0000000|C0750541|G0000000|C1705242|C1513371|G0000000|C0441472|C3541266|C0020291|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0023175|C0040363|G0000000|C0040704|C4055506|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1531217|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3541266|C0020291|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0023175|C0040363|G0000000|C0205253|C4055506|G0000000|C0596973|G0000000|C0596448|G0000000|C0439664|C0205177|G0000000|C0597484|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0392366|G0000000|G0000000|C0242772|G0000000|C0332464|C0004896|G0000000|C0162741|G0000000|G0000000|C1547282|C1705242|C0027446|G0000000|G0000000|C0032098|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0850310|G0000000|C0442821|C0597484|G0000000|C0040300|C0036974|G0000000|C1441672|G0000000|C0450371|C0702093|G0000000|C0332448|G0000000|C0332464|C0004896|C0242724|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|C0282379|G0000000|G0000000|C1555721|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|C0205145|G0000000|G0000000|C1518422|C0205171|G0000000|C0014442|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0597484|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0597484|G0000000|C0851827|G0000000|C0014442|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|C1442161|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1274040|G0000000|G0000000|C0442821|C0301630|G0000000|C0042765|G0000000|C0242772|G0000000|C0332464|C0004896|C0205225|C0221198|C0220781|G0000000|C0205421|G0000000|C0332232|C0450371|C0033727|G0000000|G0000000|C0221198|G0000000|C0871208|G0000000|C0392756|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|C1511726|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0042765|C1521761|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000
"16944135 20060901 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol D016428 A novel GH43 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Humicola insolens mode of action and synergy with GH51 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases on wheat arabinoxylan A novel alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase \( alpha-AraF \) belonging to glycoside hydrolase \( GH \) family 43 was cloned from Humicola insolens and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae \( 1 \) H-NMR analysis revealed that the novel GH43 enzyme selectively hydrolysed \( 1-- 3 \) -alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues of doubly substituted xylopyranosyl residues in arabinoxylan and in arabinoxylan-derived oligosaccharides The optimal activity of the cloned enzyme was at pH 6 7 and 53 degrees C Two other novel alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases \( alpha-AraFs \) , both belonging to GH family 51 , were cloned from H insolens and from the white-rot basidiomycete Meripilus giganteus Both GH51 enzymes catalysed removal of \( 1-- 2 \) and \( 1-- 3 \) -alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues from singly substituted xylopyranosyls in arabinoxylan the highest arabinose yields were obtained with the M giganteus enzyme Combinations \( 50 50 \) of the GH43 alpha-AraF from H insolens and the GH51 alpha-AraFs from either M giganteus or H insolens resulted in a synergistic increase in arabinose release from water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan in extended reactions at pH 6 and 40 degrees C This synergistic interaction between GH43 and GH51 alpha-AraFs was also evident when a GH43 alpha-AraF from a Bifidobacterium sp was supplemented in combination with either of the GH51 enzymes The synergistic effect is presumed to be a result of the GH51 alpha-AraFs being able to catalyse the removal of single-sitting \( 1-- 2 \) -alpha-L- arabinofuranosyls that resulted after the GH43 enzyme had catalysed the removal of \( 1-- 3 \) -alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues on doubly substituted xylopyranosyls in the wheat arabinoxylan","16944135 20060901 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol D016428 A novel

characterization of the gene product expressed in Pichia pastoris Since plant-pathogenic fungi must penetrate through pectinaceous layers of the host cell wall , pectin-degrading enzymes are thought to be important for pathogenesis Antibodies prepared against a pectin-inducible pectate lyase \( pectate lyase A PLA \) produced by a phytopathogenic fungus , Fusarium solani f sp pisi \( Nectria haematococca , mating type VI \) , was previously found to protect the host from infection The gene \( pelA \) and its cDNA were cloned and sequenced Here we report the isolation of a new pectate lyase gene , pelB , from a genomic library of F solani f sp pisi with the pelA cDNA as the probe A 2 6-kb DNA fragment containing pelB and its flanking regions was sequenced The coding region of pelB was amplified by reverse transcription-mediated PCR , using total RNA isolated from F solani pisi culture grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source The predicted open reading frame of pelB would encode a 25 6-kDa protein of 244 amino acids which has 65 amino acid sequence identity with PLA from F solani f sp pisi but no significant homology with other pectinolytic enzymes The first 16 amino acid residues at the N terminus appeared to be a signal peptide The pelB cDNA was expressed in Pichia pastoris , yielding a pectate lyase B \( PLB \) which was found to be a glycoprotein of 29 kDa PLB was purified to homogeneity by using a two-step procedure involving ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Superdex G75 gel filtration chromatography Purified PLB showed optimal lyase activity at pH 10 0 A rapid drop in the viscosity of the substrate and Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography of the products generated by the lyase showed that PLB cleaved polygalacturonate chains in an endo fashion Western blotting \( immunoblotting \) with antibodies raised against PLA showed that PLB and PLA are immunologically related to each other The 5' flanking regions of both pelA and pelB were translationally fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene and introduced into F solani f sp pisi , and beta-glucuronidase activities of the transformants were measured Expression of the marker gene by the transformants showed that pelA expression is induced by pectin and repressed by glucose , whereas expression of pelB is constitutive and is not subject to glucose repression Reverse

of eng1 , a new gene that encodes a protein with detectable endo-beta-1 , 3-glucanase activity and whose deletion is not lethal to the cells but does interfere in their separation Electron microscopic observation of mutant cells indicated that this defect is mainly due to the failure of the cells to degrade the primary septum , a structure rich in beta-1 , 3-glucans , that separates the two sisters cells Expression of eng1 varies during the cell cycle , maximum expression being observed before septation , and the protein localizes to a ring-like structure that surrounds the septum region during cell separation This suggests that it could also be involved in the cleavage of the cylinder of the cell wall that covers the division septum The expression of eng1 during vegetative growth is regulated by a C2H2 zinc-finger protein \( encoded by the SPAC6G10 12c ORF \) , which shows significant sequence similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ScAce2p , especially in the zinc-finger region Mutants lacking this transcriptional regulator \( which we have named ace2 \) show a severe cell separation defect , hyphal growth being observed Thus , ace2p may regulate the expression of the

"19556747 20090627 J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol D016428 D013485 Sequencing and expression of the xylanase gene 2 from Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 and characterization of the recombinant enzyme and its activity on xylan The Xyn2 gene , which encodes endo-beta-1 , 4-xylanase2 , in Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 was amplified by PCR from first-strand cDNA synthesized on mRNA isolated from the fungus The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment was verified to encode 190-amino-acid residues of a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 21 kDa The cDNA was cloned into pET30alpha expression vector and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals The enzyme activity assay verified the recombinant protein as xylanase The isoelectric point and highest activity were 7 5 and 1 , 600 U mg , respectively Like with the T reesei Xyn2 , the highest activity of the recombinant Xyn2 was at 50 degrees C However , the recombinant enzyme had an improved thermostability and more than 65 of its activity retained after 30 min incubation at 60 degrees C In addition , the recombinant Xyn2 was active over the range of pH 3 5-7 5 with maximum activity at pH 5 0 Using birchwood xylan , the determined apparent K \( m \) and k \( cat \) values were 0 15 mg ml and 119 7 s \( -1 \) , respectively The enzyme was highly specific towards xylans and exhibited very low activity towards cellulosic substrates Analysis of the products from birchwood xylan degradation confirmed that the enzyme was an endo-xylanase with xylobiose and xylose as the main degradation products These properties should make the enzyme a suitable applicant in various industrial applications","19556747 20090627 J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol

26 peroxidase genes was apparent after a structural-functional classification based on homology modeling and a search for diagnostic catalytic amino acid residues In addition to revealing the presence of nine heme-thiolate peroxidase superfamily members and the unexpected absence of the dye-decolorizing peroxidase superfamily , the search showed that the C subvermispora genome encodes 16 class II enzymes in the plant-fungal-bacterial peroxidase superfamily , where LiPs and VPs are classified The 16 encoded enzymes include 13 putative manganese peroxidases and one generic peroxidase but most notably two peroxidases containing the catalytic tryptophan characteristic of LiPs and VPs We expressed these two enzymes in Escherichia coli and determined their substrate specificities on typical LiP VP substrates , including nonphenolic lignin model monomers and dimers , as well as synthetic lignin The results show that the two newly discovered C subvermispora peroxidases are functionally competent LiPs and also suggest that they are phylogenetically and catalytically intermediate between classical LiPs and VPs These results offer new insight into selective lignin degradation by C

homologous expression and purification of T reesei Cel61A previously named endoglucanase \( EG \) IV The enzyme was expressed in high amounts with a histidine tag on the C-terminus and purified by metal affinity chromatography This is the first time that a histidine tag has been used as a purification aid in the T reesei expression system The enzyme activity was studied on a series of carbohydrate polymers The only activity exhibited by Cel61A was an endoglucanase activity observed on substrates containing beta-1 , 4 glycosidic bonds , e g carboxymethylcellulose \( CMC \) , hydroxyethylcellulose \( HEC \) and beta-glucan The endoglucanase activity on CMC and beta-glucan was determined by viscosity analysis , by measuring the production of reducing ends and by following the degradation of the polymer on a size exclusion chromatography system The formation of soluble sugars by Cel61A from microcrystalline cellulose \( Avicel Merck \) , phosphoric acid swollen cellulose \( PASC \) , and CMC were analysed on a HPLC system Cel61A produced small amounts of oligosaccharides from these substrates Furthermore , Cel61A showed activity against cellotetraose and cellopentaose The activity of Cel61A was several orders of magnitude lower compared to Cel7B \( previously EG I \) of T reesei on all substrates One significant difference between Cel61A and Cel7B was that cellotriose was a poor substrate for Cel61A but was readily hydrolysed by Cel7B The enzyme activity for Cel61A was further studied on a large number of carbohydrate substrates but the enzyme showed no activity towards any of these substrates","11737205 20011212 Eur J Biochem D016428 D013485 Homologous expression and characterization of Cel61A \( EG IV \) of Trichoderma reesei There are

sequence on the crystal structure of Aspergillus kawachii AkabfB showed that the catalytic amino acid arrangement and overall structure were highly similar including the N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal arabinose binding domains The abfA gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and the heterologous enzyme was purified The protein was monomeric , migrating at 49 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluting at 36 kDa upon gel filtration AbfA showed maximal activity at 55 degrees C and between pH 3 5 and pH 4 The enzyme had a K \( m \) value for p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside of 3 7 mM and a V \( max \) of 34 8 micromol min \( -1 \) mg protein \( -1 \) Arabinose acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor with a K \( i \) of 38 4 mM The enzyme released arabinose from maize fiber , oat spelt arabinoxylan , and wheat arabinoxylan , but not from larch wood arabinogalactan or alpha-1 , 5-debranched arabinan AbfA displayed low activity against alpha-1 , 5-L-arabino-oligosaccharides The enzyme acted synergistically with endo-beta-1 , 4-xylanase in the breakdown of wheat arabinoxylan Binding of AbfA to xylan from several sources confirmed the presence of a functional carbohydrate-binding module",G0000000|G0000000|C1858559|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1880022|G0000000|G0000000|C0015576|C0450371|C0051400|G0000000|C0320068|C0072595|G0000000|G0000000|C0020289|C0015576|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0051400|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0320068|C0072595|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1335439|C0337112|C0443286|G0000000|C0017428|C0012854|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|C0175566|C0034754|C0080089|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0012854|C0004793|C0870071|G0000000|G0000000|C0205250|G0000000|G0000000|C0072595|G0000000|C0033684|C0004793|G0000000|G0000000|C0427896|C0678594|G0000000|C0004034|G0000000|G0000000|C1547282|G0000000|G0000000|C0007382|G0000000|C0001128|C0449830|G0000000|C0282416|C0678594|G0000000|C0205250|C2348205|C0332257|G0000000|C0369718|C0007382|G0000000|C1707271|C0003682|C1145667|C1880389|G0000000|G0000000|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0036024|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439860|C0014442|G0000000|C1998793|G0000000|C0033684|G0000000|C0596973|G0000000|C0232902|G0000000|C0450371|C1532717|G0000000|C0037473|G0000000|C0038720|C0017243|C0013855|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C1532717|G0000000|C0017243|C0016107|G0000000|C1547282|C0205289|C0205177|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|C0597277|G0000000|C0369637|G0000000|C1522609|G0000000|C0369773|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|C0439194|C0702093|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0026410|C0033684|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0003682|C0079613|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1999216|G0000000|G0000000|C0597277|G0000000|C0021966|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|C0391871|C0003682|G0000000|C0010028|C0012173|G0000000|C0028753|C0331515|C0250438|G0000000|G0000000|C0043137|C0250438|G0000000|G0000000|C1518422|G0000000|C0884985|C0043217|C0052276|G0000000|C0439095|G0000000|G0000000|C0052274|G0000000|C0870432|C0205251|C0205177|G0000000|C0439095|G0000000|C0439394|G0000000|C0014442|C0079613|G0000000|G0000000|C0014175|G0000000|C0059100|G0000000|G0000000|C0443161|G0000000|C0043137|C0250438|C1145667|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0439064|C0449416|C0521093|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0205245|C1148582|C1709061

"12071852 20020620 Biochem J D016428 D013485 An intron-containing glycoside hydrolase family 9 cellulase gene encodes the dominant 90 kDa component of the cellulosome of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp strain E2 The cellulosome produced by Piromyces sp strain E2 during growth on filter paper was purified by using an optimized cellulose-affinity method consisting of steps of EDTA washing of the cellulose-bound protein followed by elution with water Three dominant proteins were identified in the cellulosome preparation , with molecular masses of 55 , 80 and 90 kDa Treatment of cellulose-bound cellulosome with a number of denaturing agents was also tested Incubation with 0 5 \( w v \) SDS or 8 M urea released most cellulosomal proteins , while leaving the greater fraction of the 80 , 90 and 170 kDa components To investigate the major 90 kDa cellulosome protein further , the corresponding gene , cel9A , was isolated , using immunoscreening and N-terminal sequencing Inspection of the cel9A genomic organization revealed the presence of four introns , allowing the construction of a consensus for introns in anaerobic fungi The 2800 bp cDNA clone contained an open reading frame of 2334 bp encoding a 757-residue extracellular protein Cel9A includes a 445-residue glycoside hydrolase family 9 catalytic domain , and so is the first fungal representative of this large family Both modelling

An intron-containing glycoside hydrolase family 9 cellulase gene encodes the dominant 90 kDa component of the cellulosome of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp strain E2 The cellulosome produced by Piromyces sp strain E2 during growth on filter paper was purified by using an optimized cellulose-affinity method consisting of steps of EDTA washing of the cellulose-bound protein followed by elution with water Three dominant proteins were identified in the cellulosome preparation , with molecular masses of 55 , 80 and 90 kDa Treatment of cellulose-bound cellulosome with a number of denaturing agents was also tested Incubation with 0 5 \( w v \) SDS or 8 M urea released most cellulosomal proteins , while leaving the greater fraction of the 80 , 90 and 170 kDa components To investigate the major 90 kDa cellulosome protein further , the corresponding gene , cel9A , was isolated , using immunoscreening and N-terminal sequencing Inspection of the cel9A genomic organization revealed the presence of four introns , allowing the construction of a consensus for introns in anaerobic fungi The 2800 bp cDNA clone contained an open reading frame of 2334 bp encoding a 757-residue extracellular protein Cel9A includes a 445-residue glycoside hydrolase family 9 catalytic domain , and so is the first fungal representative of this large family Both modelling of the catalytic domain

The complete gene , including its promoter region , was obtained by genomic walking Southern analysis showed that cr-nag1 is present as a single copy gene in C rosea Phylogenetically , cr-nag1 showed the highest similarity to N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase genes from other mycoparasitic fungi Enzymatic assays and RT-PCR showed that the NAGase activity of C rosea is specifically repressed in medium containing a high glucose content and is expressed in media containing chitin or Fusarium culmorum cell walls as sole carbon sources Macroscopic and microscopic observations indicated that the mycelial growth of F culmorum and Pythium ultimum were inhibited during interactions with C rosea High expression of cr-nag1 was found in interactions between C rosea and F culmorum , whereas the expression of cr-nag1 in interactions between C rosea and P ultimum was similar to the control This indicates that although C rosea secretes chitin-hydrolysing agents in order to target the cell wall of F culmorum , it seems to use another strategy for controlling the development of the oomycete P ultimum","18675351 20080805 Mycol Res D016428 D013485 An N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase gene ,

chrysosporium was fused to the coding region of the mnp2 gene of D squalens , 5 bp upstream of the translation start site , and placed in a vector containing the ural gene as a selectable marker Purified recombinant protein \( rDsMnP \) was similar in kinetic and spectral characteristics to both the wild-type MnPs from D squalens and P chrysosporium \( PcMnP \) The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the rDsMnP was determined and was identical to the predicted sequence Cleavage of the propeptide followed a conserved amino acid motif \( A-A-P-S T \) in both rDsMnP and PcMnP However ,

to that of the wild-type protein Steady-state kinetic analyses of the E35Q and E39Q mutant MnPs yielded K \( m \) values for the substrate MnII that were approximately 50-fold greater than the corresponding K \( m \) value for the wild-type enzyme Likewise , the kcat values for MnII oxidation were approximately 300-fold lower than that for wild-type MnP With the E35Q-D179N double mutant , the K \( m \) value for MnII was approximately 120-fold greater , and the kcat value was approximately 1000-fold less than that for the wild-type MnP1 Transient-state kinetic analysis of the reduction of MnP compound II by MnII allowed the determination of the equilibrium dissociation constants \( KD \) and first- order rate constants for the mutant proteins The KD values were approximately 100-fold higher for the single mutants and approximately 200-fold higher for the double mutant , as compared with the wild-type enzyme The first-order rate constants for the single and double mutants were approximately 200-fold and approximately 4000-fold less , respectively , than that of the wild-type enzyme In contrast , the K \( m \) values for H2O2 and the rates of compound I formation were similar for the mutant and wild-type MnPs The second-order rate constants for p-cresol and ferrocyanide reduction of the mutant compounds II also were similar to those of the wild-type

Expression of aglA is only detected on galactose and galactose-containing oligomers and polymers The aglB gene is expressed on all of the carbon sources tested , including glucose Elevated expression was observed on xylan , which could be assigned to regulation via XlnR , the xylanolytic transcriptional activator Expression of aglC was only observed on glucose , fructose , and combinations of glucose with xylose and galactose High expression of lacA was detected on arabinose , xylose , xylan , and pectin Similar to aglB , the expression on xylose and xylan can be assigned to regulation via XlnR All four genes have distinct expression patterns which seem to mirror the natural substrates of the encoded proteins",G0000000|G0000000|C1858559|C1568941|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0443199|C0185117|G0000000|C0205449|C0002268|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|C0037179|C0005220|C0017337|G0000000|C0004034|C0028074|G0000000|C0017337|C1547699|G0000000|C0205437|C0002268|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0004034|C0028074|G0000000|G0000000|C0009013|G0000000|C0004793|G0000000|C0017337|C0332529|G0000000|G0000000|C0175566|C0034754|C0080089|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|C0037623|C0332256|C0205452|C0021920|G0000000|C0017337|C2700640|G0000000|C0033684|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|C0332256|G0000000|C0015161|C1710082|C0004793|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|C0205453|G0000000|C0369718|C0205145|G0000000|C0205286|C0033684|G0000000|G0000000|C0444686|C1521991|C0577559|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|C1442061|C0011318|G0000000|G0000000|C0681842|C0429863|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1706765|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|C0004793|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0002268|C0443289|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C1711207|G0000000|C0002268|G0000000|G0000000|C0332257|G0000000|C0028074|C1493439|G0000000|C0028074|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C1705242|C1711207|G0000000|C0332529|G0000000|G0000000|C0686817|C0002268|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|C1493439|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3454521|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2700640|G0000000|G0000000|C0028074|C0005220|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0557651|G0000000|C1524063|G0000000|C0237753|G0000000|C0596973|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0032521|C0205198|G0000000|C0018270|C1710236|C0185117|G0000000|C1493439|G0000000|C0205171|C0442726|G0000000|C0016945|G0000000|C0016945|G0000000|G0000000|C0032521|G0000000|G0000000|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007009|C0449416|C0392366|G0000000|C0332257|C0017725|C0205250|C0185117|G0000000|C1441672|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1516050|C0040363|C0851285|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040649|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205171|C1441672|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C0016745|G0000000|G0000000|C0453882|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C0043375|G0000000|C0016945|C0205250|C0185117|G0000000|C3454521|G0000000|C0442726|G0000000|C0003682|G0000000|C0043375|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0070203|C2348205|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|C0043375|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1516050|C0040363|C0851285|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205450|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|C0185117|C0449774|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|C0181868|G0000000|C0205296|C1710236|G0000000|G0000000|C0679058|C0033684

Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been cloned , sequenced , and expressed in Pichia pastoris The complete amino acid sequence of the exo-beta-1 , 3-galactanase indicated that the enzyme consists of an N-terminal catalytic module with similarity to glycoside hydrolase family 43 and an additional unknown functional domain similar to carbohydrate-binding module family 6 \( CBM6 \) in the C-terminal region The molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was estimated as 55 kDa based on SDS-PAGE The enzyme showed reactivity only toward beta-1 , 3-linked galactosyl oligosaccharides and polysaccharide

affinity chromatography for the CBM6 moiety using several kinds of terminal galactose-containing oligosaccharides as the analytes clearly indicated that the CBM6 specifically interacted with

"22450796 20120328 J Microbiol Biotechnol D016428 D013485 Cloning , expression , and characterization of endoglucanase gene egIV from Trichoderma viride AS 3 3711 Endoglucanase gene egIV was cloned from Trichoderma viride AS 3 3711 , an important cellulose-producing fungus , by using an RT-PCR protocol The egIV cDNA is 1 , 297 bp in length and contains a 1 , 035 bp open reading frame encoding a 344 amino acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 35 5 kDa and isoelectronic point \( pI \) of 5 29 The expression of gene egIV in T viride AS 3 3711 could be induced by sucrose , corn straw , carboxymethylcellulose \( CMC \) , or microcrystalline cellulose , but especially by CMC The transcripts of egIV were regulated under these substrates , but the expression level of the egIV gene could be inhibited by glucose and fructose Three recombinant vectors , pYES2-xegIV , pYES2Malpha-egIV , and pYES2Malpha-xegIV , were constructed to express the egIV gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae H158 The CMCase activity of yeast transformants IpYES2Malpha-xegIV was higher than that of transformant IpYES2-xegIV or IpYES2Malpha-egIV , with the highest activity of 0 13 U ml at induction for 48 h , illustrating that the modified egIV gene could enhance CMCase activity and that MFalpha signal peptide from S cerevisiae could regulate exogenous gene expression more effectively in S cerevisiae The recombinant EGIV enzyme was stable at pH 3 5 to 7 5 and temperature of 35 degrees C to 65 degrees C The optimal reaction condition for EGIV enzyme activity was at the temperature of 55 degrees C , pH of 5 0 , 0 75 mM Ba , and using CMC as substrate Under these conditions , the highest activity of EGIV enzyme in transformant IpYES2Malpha-xegIV was 0 18 U ml These properties would provide technical

immunoscreening with anti-cellulosome antibodies was used to isolate the corresponding gene A 2737 bp immunoclone was isolated from a cDNA library The clone encoded an extracellular protein containing a eukaryotic family 3 glycoside hydrolase domain homologue and was therefore named cel3A The C-terminal end of the encoded Cel3A protein consisted of an auxiliary domain and three fungal dockerins ,

It is a glycosylated monomer with a molecular weight of 50 , 700 and can bind cellulose The enzyme is active with p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xylopyranoside with a K \( m \) of 0 65 mM and 12 mM , respectively The enzyme is active on xylooligosaccharides , yielding products of shorter length , including xylose However , it does not hydrolyze arabinooligosaccharides When assayed with polymeric substrates , little arabinose is liberated from arabinan and debranched arabinan however , it hydrolyzes arabinose and releases xylooligosaccharides from arabinoxylan Sequencing both ABF3 cDNA and genomic DNA reveals that this gene does not contain introns and that the open reading frame is 1 , 380 nucleotides in length The deduced mature protein is composed of 433 amino acids residues and has a calculated molecular weight of 47 , 305 The deduced amino acid sequence has been validated by mass spectrometry analysis of peptides from purified ABF3 A total of 482 bp of the promoter were sequenced putative binding sites for transcription factors such as CreA \( four \) , XlnR \( one \) , and AreA \( three \) and two CCAAT boxes were found The enzyme has two domains , one similar to proteins of glycosyl hydrolase family 43 at the amino-terminal end and a family 6 carbohydrate binding module at the carboxyl end ABF3 is the first described modular family 43 enzyme from a fungal source , having both alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase and xylobiohydrolase

38 identity to the Schwanniomyces occidentalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC2 invertases When the inv1 \( \) gene was disrupted , S pombe strains lacked detectable invertase activity This result showed that the inv1 \( \) gene encodes only one active invertase in S pombe cells The transcription of inv1 \( \) is repressed in the presence of glucose The transcription of inv1 \( \) was not affected in cyr1Delta strain which lacks adenylate cyclase activity , unlike transcription of S pombe fbp1 \( \) gene We have identified an S pombe gene \( scr1 \( \) \) that encodes a homolog of the

Schizosaccharomyces pombe PCR was used to isolate an invertase homolog gene from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe The cloned inv1 \( \) gene encodes a protein of 581 amino acids with 16 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites , and has 39 and 38 identity to the Schwanniomyces occidentalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC2 invertases When the inv1 \( \) gene was disrupted , S pombe strains lacked detectable invertase activity This result showed that the inv1 \( \) gene encodes only one active invertase in S pombe cells The transcription of inv1 \( \) is repressed in the presence of glucose The transcription of inv1 \( \) was not affected in cyr1Delta strain which lacks adenylate cyclase activity , unlike transcription of S pombe fbp1 \( \) gene We have identified an S pombe gene \( scr1 \( \) \) that encodes a homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans CREA which is required for glucose repression of the glyconeogenic pathway Although the deletion of scr1 \( \) did not influence the transcription of fbp1 \( \) gene , glucose repression of the inv1 \( \) gene was severely affected These results showed that glucose repression of inv1 \( \) gene is dependent on scr1 \(

mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 120 kDa by gel filtration and 58 kDa by SDS-PAGE suggesting , the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits It was most active at pH 3 0-3 5 and at 40 degrees C It was stable in pH 2 0-4 5 and below 30 degrees C It hydrolyzed O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid alpha-D-glucosiduronic acid to produce alpha- and beta-anomers of D-glucuronic acid in an equimolar ratio This result suggests that inversion of the anomeric configuration of the substrate is involved in the hydrolysis

"12137954 20020726 Gene D016428 D013485 Differences in expression of two endoxylanase genes \( xynA and xynB \) from Penicillium purpurogenum A number of xylanolytic microorganisms secrete to the medium several molecular forms of endoxylanases The physiological function of these isoforms is not clear one possibility is that they are produced under different growth conditions To study this problem , we have used two endoxylanases \( XynA and XynB \) produced by the fungus Penicillium purpurogenum These enzymes have been previously purified and characterized they belong to family 10 and 11 of the glycosyl hydrolases , respectively The promoters of the xynA and xynB genes have been sequenced both present consensus sequences for the binding of the carbon catabolite repressor CreA , but otherwise show substantial differences The xynB promoter has eight boxes in tandem for the binding of the XlnR activator and lacks the consensus sequence for the PacC pH regulator On the other hand , the xynA promoter contains one XlnR box and three PacC consensus sequences To investigate if these differences are reflected in gene expression , Northern blot assays were carried out The xynA gene is transiently expressed when oat spelt xylan is used as carbon source , but negligible expression was observed with birchwood xylan , xylose or xylitol In contrast , xynB is broadly induced by all these carbon sources this may be related to the presence of several XlnR boxes Similar results were obtained by zymogram analysis of the expressed proteins The different induction capabilities of birchwood and oat spelt xylan may be due to differences in their composition and structure Expression assays carried out at different pH reflects that , despite the lack of PacC binding sites in the xynB

purpurogenum A number of xylanolytic microorganisms secrete to the medium several molecular forms of endoxylanases The physiological function of these isoforms is not clear one possibility is that they are produced under different growth conditions To study this problem , we have used two endoxylanases \( XynA and XynB \) produced by the fungus Penicillium purpurogenum These enzymes have been previously purified and characterized they belong to family 10 and 11 of the glycosyl hydrolases , respectively The promoters of the xynA and xynB genes have been sequenced both present consensus sequences for the binding of the carbon catabolite repressor CreA , but otherwise show substantial differences The xynB promoter has eight boxes in tandem for the binding of the XlnR activator and lacks the consensus sequence for the PacC pH regulator On the other hand , the xynA promoter contains one XlnR box and three PacC consensus sequences To investigate if these differences are reflected in gene expression , Northern blot assays were carried out The xynA gene is transiently expressed when oat spelt xylan is used as carbon source , but negligible expression was observed with birchwood xylan , xylose or xylitol In contrast , xynB is broadly induced by all these carbon sources this may be related to the presence of several XlnR boxes Similar results were obtained by zymogram analysis of the expressed proteins The different induction capabilities of birchwood and oat spelt xylan may be due to differences in their composition and structure Expression assays carried out at different pH reflects that , despite the lack of PacC binding sites in the xynB promoter , this gene is tightly regulated by pH The findings described here illustrate new and important differences between endoxylanases from families 10 and 11 in P purpurogenum They may help explain the production of multiple endoxylanase forms by this

starch-binding domain The two genes encode proteins that are approximately 50 identical to the catalytic region of the AmyA protein and 67 identical to each other The predicted AmyC and AmyD proteins contain the highly conserved signature sequences of Family 15 glycoside hydrolases The two genes appear to be transcriptionally expressed in cultures grown in fermentable and gluconeogenic carbon sources The predicted 49 7-kD AmyC and 48 8-kD AmyD proteins were expressed in several different ways using Pichia pastoris When the sequence for putative secretion signal was left intact ,

a starch binding domain from Rhizopus oryzae Glucoamylase obtained from Rhizopus sp is frequently preferred for certain applications of starch modification or saccharification The predominant enzyme , which contains a starch-binding domain on the amino terminus , has been previously characterized from several species Additionally , the cDNA encoding this protein was cloned and found to show 100 identity to a R oryzae strain 99-880 that has recently been sequenced by the Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Analysis of this genome indicates coding regions for two additional glucoamylase genes , amyC and amyD , lacking a starch-binding domain The two genes encode proteins that are approximately 50 identical to the catalytic region of the AmyA protein and 67 identical to each other The predicted AmyC and AmyD proteins contain the highly conserved signature sequences of Family 15 glycoside hydrolases The two genes appear to be transcriptionally expressed in cultures grown in fermentable and gluconeogenic carbon sources The predicted 49 7-kD AmyC and 48 8-kD AmyD proteins were expressed in several different ways using Pichia pastoris When the sequence for putative secretion signal was left intact , glucoamylase activity was detected in the crude cell extracts , but no activity was present in the growth medium However , replacement of this region with the yeast alpha-secretion signal resulted in secretion of active glucoamylase that was able to degrade soluble

"17002602 20060928 Biochem J D016428 D013485 Mutagenesis and mechanistic study of a glycoside hydrolase family 54 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Trichoderma koningii A GH \( glycoside hydrolase \) family 54 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Trichoderma koningii G-39 \( termed Abf \) was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to near homogeneity by cation-exchange chromatography To determine the amino acid residues essential for the catalytic activity of Abf , extensive mutagenesis of 24 conserved glutamate and aspartate residues was performed Among the mutants , D221N , E223Q and D299N were found to decrease catalytic activity significantly The kcat values of the D221N and D299N mutants were 7000- and 1300-fold lower respectively , than that of the wild-type Abf E223Q was nearly inactive These results are consistent with observations obtained from the Aspergillus kawachii alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase three-dimensional structure This structure indicates that Asp221 of T koningii Abf is significant for substrate binding and that Glu223 as well as Asp299 function as a nucleophile and a general acid base catalyst for the enzymatic reaction respectively The catalytic mechanism of wild-type Abf was further investigated by NMR spectroscopy and kinetic analysis The results showed that Abf is a retaining enzyme It catalyses the hydrolysis of various substrates via the formation of a common intermediate that is probably an arabinosyl-enzyme intermediate A two-step , double-displacement mechanism involving first the formation , and then the

revealed that the catalytic activity of this mutant depended largely on the pK \( a \) values \( 6 \) of leaving phenols , with beta \( lg \) -1 3 , indicating that the rate-limiting step of the

"21237221 20110118 J Biotechnol D016428 Homologous overexpression of xylanase in Fusarium oxysporum increases ethanol productivity during consolidated bioprocessing \( CBP \) of lignocellulosics In an effort to increase ethanol productivity during the consolidated bioprocessing \( CBP \) of lignocellulosics by Fusarium oxysporum , we attempted the constitutive homologous overexpression of one of the key process enzymes , namely an endo-xylanase The endo- -1 , 4-xylanase 2 gene was incorporated into the F oxysporum genome under the regulation of the gpdA promoter of Aspergillus nidulans The transformation was effected through Agrobacterium tumefaciens and resulted in 12 transformants , two of which were selected for further study due to their high extracellular xylanase activities under normally repressing conditions \( glucose as sole carbon source \) During natural induction conditions \( growth on xylan \) though , the extracellular enzyme levels of the transformants were only

consolidated bioprocessing \( CBP \) of lignocellulosics In an effort to increase ethanol productivity during the consolidated bioprocessing \( CBP \) of lignocellulosics by Fusarium oxysporum , we attempted the constitutive homologous overexpression of one of the key process enzymes , namely an endo-xylanase The endo- -1 , 4-xylanase 2 gene was incorporated into the F oxysporum genome under the regulation of the gpdA promoter of Aspergillus nidulans The transformation was effected through Agrobacterium tumefaciens and resulted in 12 transformants , two of which were selected for further study due to their high extracellular xylanase activities under normally repressing conditions \( glucose as sole carbon source \) During natural induction conditions \( growth on xylan \) though , the extracellular enzyme levels of the transformants were only marginally higher \( 5-10 \) compared to the wild type despite the significantly stronger xylanase 2 mRNA signals SDS-PAGE verified

advances in metabolic engineering have demonstrated that microbial biosynthesis can provide a viable alternative to chemical synthesis for the production of bulk and fine chemicals Introduction of a new biosynthetic pathway typically requires the expression of multiple heterologous enzymes in the production host , which can impose stress on the host cell and , thereby , limit performance of the pathway Unfortunately , analysis and treatment of the host stress response can be difficult , because there are many sources of stress that may interact in complex ways We use a systems biological

Identification and treatment of heme depletion attributed to overexpression of a lineage of evolved P450 monooxygenases Recent advances in metabolic engineering have demonstrated that microbial biosynthesis can provide a viable alternative to chemical synthesis for the production of bulk and fine chemicals Introduction of a new biosynthetic pathway typically requires the expression of multiple heterologous enzymes in the production host , which can impose stress on the host cell and , thereby , limit performance of the pathway Unfortunately , analysis and treatment of the host stress response can be difficult , because there are many sources of stress that may interact in complex ways We use a systems biological approach to analyze the stress imposed by expressing different enzyme variants from a lineage of soluble P450 monooxygenases , previously evolved for heterologous activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Our analysis identifies patterns of stress imposed on the host

not to the inuA probe , regardless of the carbon source The data suggest that only the inuB gene was transcribed constitutively Four distinct 5' ends of the transcripts were observed at positions -80 \( A \) , -72 \( G \) , -69 \( A \) , and -65 \( A \) from the start codon The inuB mRNAs were polyadenylated at various sites between 94 and 297 bp downstream of the stop codon We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the 1201- and 1017-bp 5'-noncoding regions of the inuA and inuB genes , respectively The inuB promoter region included a putative TATA box at -116 \( TATATA

variants , A35V and A35S , respectively , were fully active Because of their thermal tolerance , S sp 11AG8 Cel12A and T reesei Cel12A variant A35V showed a continual increase in activity over the temperature range of 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C , whereas the less stable enzymes T reesei Cel12A wild type and the destabilized A35S variant , and H schweinitzii Cel12A showed a decrease in activity at the highest temperatures The crystal structures of the H schweinitzii , S sp 11AG8 , and T reesei A35V Cel12A enzymes have been determined and compared with the wild-type T reesei Cel12A enzyme All of the structures have similar Calpha traces , but provide detailed insight into the nature of the stability differences These results are an example of the power of homolog recruitment as a method for identifying residues important for stability",G0000000|G0000000|C0033684|C3642273|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1707455|G0000000|C0015576|C0450371|C0007158|C0020289|G0000000|G0000000|C1555721|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205360|G0000000|C0449719|G0000000|G0000000|C1709697|C0040363|C1880355|C0184511|C0007158|C0020289|C0015576|C0450371|G0000000|C0033993|C0450371|G0000000|C0007641|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0557651|G0000000|C0205474|C1880371|G0000000|C0439064|C0033993|C0450371|C1334043|G0000000|C0033727|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C0205171|C0450371|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|C0450371|C0004793|C0424215|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205393|C0439092|G0000000|C0205360|G0000000|C0521009|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C0565930|C0037747|G0000000|C0237876|C0205171|C0450371|C0004793|C0424215|C0040363|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205393|C0205172|G0000000|C0205360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0004793|C1705241|G0000000|C0033727|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1292748|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C1280500|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|C1555721|G0000000|C0014442|C0205360|C0439064|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0205419|G0000000|C0150312|C0040363|G0000000|C0205217|C0205360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1705241|G0000000|C0750489|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0301642|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|C0369637|G0000000|G0000000|C1514721|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0449286|G0000000|C0442805|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0449286|G0000000|C0392756|G0000000|C0439092|C0205360|C2949735|G0000000|C0033727|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1555721|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205172|C0205360|C0565930|C0037747|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0205419|G0000000|C0150312|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|C0369637|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0449286|G0000000|C0205250|G0000000|C0445392|C0332307|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1709915|G0000000|C0733755|C0450371|G0000000|C1547282|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C1511545|C3898777|G0000000|G0000000|C0205360|G0000000|G0000000|C0678594|C0015576|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1514721|G0000000|G0000000|C0205369|C0441655|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1334043|G0000000|C0483204|G0000000|C0205393|G0000000|C0439092|C0205360|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0205419|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0013220|G0000000|C0565930|C0037747|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0205419|G0000000|C1547282|G0000000|C0439598|C0442805|G0000000|C0205177|C0205136|G0000000|C0005903|C1514721|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|C0040363|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439092|C0205360|C0014442|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0445392|C0332307|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205419|G0000000|G0000000|C0033727|G0000000|G0000000|C1547282|G0000000|C0392756|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|C1522410|C0039476|G0000000|C0427896|C0678594|G0000000|G0000000|C0033727|G0000000|G0000000|C0565930|C0037747|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1707455|G0000000|G0000000|C1883559|C2603360|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0678594|G0000000|C2348205|G0000000|C0442822|G0000000|G0000000|C1999230|C1522508|C0233820|G0000000|G0000000|C0349590|G0000000|G0000000|C0205360|C1705241|G0000000|C1274040|G0000000|G0000000|C1707959|G0000000|G0000000|C0032863|G0000000|C1334043|C2949735|G0000000|G0000000|C0025663|G0000000|G0000000|C1709915|G0000000|G0000000|C0205360

When the above kinetic constants were used in the computer model , the predicted rates of glucose formation agreed well with the experimental data Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which is unable to ferment cellobiose or cellodextrins , ferments glucose about twice as fast as C wickerhamii If S cerevisiae is cultured on cellobiose or cellodextrins and the purified C wickerhamii beta-glucosidase is added to the S cerevisiae culture at levels that mimic the production of beta-glucosidase by a C wickerhamii culture with time , the two cultures produce ethanol at equivalent rates This suggests that the

Km values for the series , cellobiose through cellohexaose , were 210 7 , 106 6 , 106 3 , 105 9 , and 79 8 mM , respectively , whereas the kcat values were 14 79 , 13 24 , 13 78 , 15 13 , and 7 66 mumol of glucose min-1 mg-1 of protein , respectively A computer program was developed to estimate the integrated rate equation When the above kinetic constants were used in the computer model , the predicted rates of glucose formation agreed well with the experimental data Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which is unable to ferment cellobiose or cellodextrins , ferments glucose about twice as fast as C wickerhamii If S cerevisiae is cultured on cellobiose or cellodextrins and the purified C wickerhamii beta-glucosidase is added to the S cerevisiae culture at levels that mimic the production of beta-glucosidase by a C wickerhamii culture with time , the two cultures produce ethanol at equivalent rates This suggests that the rate-limiting step in the fermentation of cellobiose cellodextrins by C wickerhamii is the production of beta-glucosidase",G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0201682|G0000000|G0000000|C0022702|C1880022|G0000000|G0000000|C0005223|G0000000|G0000000|C0036025|G0000000|C0006836|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007634|C0330390|G0000000|C0017764|G0000000|C0006836|G0000000|G0000000|C1880022|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C0150312|C0040363|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C0007630|G0000000|C0108983|G0000000|C0441889|G0000000|C0314672|G0000000|C0205449|C0040363|C0205452|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0015252|G0000000|G0000000|C0205088|C0017725|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0444930|G0000000|G0000000|C1134651|G0000000|G0000000|C0042295|G0000000|G0000000|C0205549|G0000000|C0007630|G0000000|C0389529|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0042295|G0000000|C0450371|C0450371|G0000000|C0450371|C0450371|G0000000|C0450371|C0450371|G0000000|C0450371|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0017725|C0702093|C0026410|G0000000|C0033684|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0009622|C1709697|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|C0750572|G0000000|G0000000|C0871208|C0552449|G0000000|G0000000|C1282910|C0022702|C1547014|G0000000|C1273517|G0000000|G0000000|C0009622|C3161035|G0000000|G0000000|C0681842|C0871208|G0000000|C0017725|C0220781|C3641827|C0205170|G0000000|G0000000|C1517586|C1511726|C0036024|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1299582|C0040363|C0014442|C0007630|G0000000|C0108983|G0000000|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C1720725|G0000000|C0015663|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0565930|G0000000|G0000000|C0010453|G0000000|C0007630|G0000000|C0108983|G0000000|G0000000|C1998793|G0000000|G0000000|C0005223|G0000000|C1524062|C0040363|G0000000|C0565930|G0000000|C0010453|G0000000|C0441889|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0033268|G0000000|C0005223|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0010453|G0000000|C0040223|G0000000|G0000000|C0205448|C0010453|G0000000|C0001962|G0000000|C0205163|C0871208|G0000000|C1705535|G0000000|G0000000|C0871208|C1261552|G0000000|G0000000|C0015852|G0000000|C0007630|C0108983|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0033268|G0000000|C0005223

respectively Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that starting from the N termini , both CelA and CelC had signal peptides , which were followed by noncatalytic repeated peptide domains \( NCRPD \) containing two repeated sequences of 33 to 40 amino acid residues functioning as docking domains The NCRPDs and the catalytic domains were separated by linker sequences The NCRPDs were homologous to those found in several hydrolases of anaerobic fungi , whereas the catalytic domains were homologous to the catalytic domains of fungal cellobiohydrolases and bacterial endoglucanases The linker sequence of CelA contained predominantly glutamine and proline residues , while that of CelC contained mainly threonine residues CelA and CelC did not have a typical cellulose binding domain \( CBD \) CelA and CelC expressed in E coli rapidly decreased the viscosity of carboxymethyl cellulose \( CMC \) , indicating that there was endoglucanase activity In addition , they produced cellobiose from CMC , acid-swollen cellulose , and cellotetraose , suggesting that they had cellobiohydrolase activity The optimal activity conditions with CMC as the substrate were pH 4 3 to 6 8 and 50 degrees C for CelA and pH 4 6 to 7 0 and 40 degrees C for CelC Despite the lack of a CBD , CelC displayed a high affinity for microcrystalline cellulose , whereas CelA did not",G0000000|G0000000|C1858559|C1568941|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205448|C1260229|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439743|C3641081|C0016832|C0600473|C0080194|C0031995|C0332256|C0369718|C0442632|C1880389|G0000000|G0000000|C0007641|C0439855|C0205448|C0006556|C1547699|C0205448|C1260229|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205409|G0000000|G0000000|C0006556|C0023621|G0000000|G0000000|C0439743|C3641081|C0016832|C0600473|C0037747|C0080194|C0031995|C2827421|G0000000|C0014833|G0000000|C0028630|C1294197|C0443289|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0006556|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|C0037623|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0006556|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|C0037623|G0000000|G0000000|C0175566|C0034754|C0180979|C1547699|C1305923|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1442061|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205448|C0006556|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|C0205280|G0000000|G0000000|C0028630|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|C0441889|G0000000|G0000000|C0002778|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0001128|C0162326|C1547282|G0000000|C0439659|G0000000|G0000000|C0369718|C0205088|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1710082|C0030956|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0332283|G0000000|G0000000|C0205341|C0030956|C1880389|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0332256|C0205448|C0205341|C0162326|G0000000|C0450371|C0040363|C0450371|G0000000|C0001128|C1709915|C0205245|G0000000|C0442632|C1880389|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007382|C1880389|G0000000|C0086972|G0000000|G0000000|C0162326|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1334043|C0040363|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|C0439064|C0020289|G0000000|C3641081|C0016832|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007382|C1880389|G0000000|C1334043|C0040363|G0000000|C0007382|C1880389|G0000000|C0016832|C0059939|G0000000|C0521009|C0007641|G0000000|G0000000|C0004793|G0000000|G0000000|C0332256|G0000000|C0017797|G0000000|C0033382|C1709915|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0332256|G0000000|C0040005|C1709915|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1518422|G0000000|G0000000|C3538928|C0007648|C1145667|C1880389|G0000000|C0006863|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0456962|C0205216|G0000000|C0042784|G0000000|G0000000|C0007648|G0000000|C0065772|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007641|C0205177|G0000000|C0332287|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007630|G0000000|C0065772|G0000000|C0001128|C0007648|G0000000|G0000000|C0055038|G0000000|C1705535|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0059939|C0205177|G0000000|C2698651|C0205177|C0012634|G0000000|C0065772|G0000000|G0000000|C1710236|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0449286|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0332268|G0000000|G0000000|C0006863|G0000000|G0000000|C0870432|G0000000|C0205250|C1510827|G0000000|C3255829|C0007648|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1518422

based on beta-galactosidase , the Sz pombe colonies develop the blue colouration under normal growth conditions , avoiding the need to replicate colonies to fresh plates for analysis It is therefore suitable for screening large numbers of colonies To illustrate the use of mel1 as a reporter we linked expression to the sxa2 gene promoter to provide a convenient readout for signalling through the pheromone response pathway The sxa2 mel1 strain identified constitutively active Mam2 pheromone receptors from a randomly mutagenised library There was an approximate correlation between the intensity of the blue colour developed by each mutant colony and its level of constitutive activity and we identified a subset of mutants with low constitutive activity that could not have been isolated by a previous screen using nutritional selection The mel1 alpha-galactosidase activity identified and characterised in this study can be easily adapted to provide a gene reporter for many biological

a non-citrus race that is non-pathogenic to citrus fruits In this research , we found that the PG activity of the citrus race isolates was much higher than that of the non-citrus race isolates in culture medium and inoculated lemon peel , and that there was a significant correlation between the PG activity and pathogenicity We isolated the two corresponding PG genes , S31pg1 and S63pg1 , from citrus race S31 and non-citrus race S63 , respectively S31PG1 and S63PG1 consisted of 368 and 369 amino acids , respectively The two PG genes showed 68 identity at the amino acid level In expression

Pathol D016428 Comparison of endo-polygalacturonase activities of citrus and non-citrus races of Geotrichum candidum , and cloning and expression of the corresponding genes summary Geotrichum candidum citrus race , a fungus that causes a sour rot disease in citrus fruits , secretes an endo-polygalacturonase \( PG \) that may facilitate the disease There also exists a non-citrus race that is non-pathogenic to citrus fruits In this research , we found that the PG activity of the citrus race isolates was much higher than that of the non-citrus race isolates in culture medium and inoculated lemon peel , and that there was a significant correlation between the PG activity and pathogenicity We isolated the two corresponding PG genes , S31pg1 and S63pg1 , from citrus race S31 and non-citrus race S63 , respectively S31PG1 and S63PG1 consisted of 368 and 369 amino acids , respectively The two PG genes showed 68 identity at the amino acid level In expression studies , S31pg1 transcript was detected in mycelia grown in liquid cultures of citrus race S31 containing either glucose , pectin or lemon peel broth The transcript was also detected in lemon peel inoculated with the isolate On the other hand , no transcript of S63pg1 was detected in mycelia grown on any liquid cultures of non-citrus race S63 and lemon peel inoculated with the isolate These results indicate that PG may play an

mRNA extracted from the anaerobic fungus , Orpinomyces joyonii strain SG4 The nucleotide sequences of celB2 and celB29 and the primary structures of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs were determined The larger celB29 cDNA was 1966bp long and encoded a 477 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 54kDa Analysis of the 1451bp celB2 cDNA revealed an 1164bp open reading frame coding for a 44kDa protein consisting of 388 amino acids Both deduced proteins had a high sequence similarity in central regions containing putative catalytic domains Primary structure analysis revealed that CelB29 contained a Thr Pro-rich sequence that separated the N-terminal catalytic domain from a C-terminal reiterated region of unknown function Homology analysis showed that both enzymes belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 5 and were most closely related to endoglucanases from the anaerobic fungi Neocallimastic patriciarum , Neocallimastix frontalis and Orpinomyces sp The classification of CelB29 and CelB2 as endoglucanases was supported by enzyme assays The cloned enzymes had high activities towards barley beta-glucan , lichenan and carboxymethylcellulose \( CMC \) , but not Avicel ,

3-beta-glucanases from S cerevisiae and C albicans reveals that enzymes with this type of specificity constitute a family of highly conserved proteins in yeasts KlExg1p , HpExg1p and SoExg1p contain the invariant amino acid positions which have been shown to be important in the catalytic function of family 5 glycosyl
