"24039705 20130917 PLoS ONE D016428 D013485 The crystal structure of the core domain of a cellulose induced protein \( Cip1 \) from Hypocrea jecorina , at 1 5 resolution In an effort to characterise the whole transcriptome of the fungus Hypocrea jecorina , cDNA clones of this fungus were identified that encode for previously unknown proteins that are likely to function in biomass degradation One of these newly identified proteins , found to be co-regulated with the major H jecorina cellulases , is a protein that was denoted Cellulose induced protein 1 \( Cip1 \) This protein consists of a glycoside hydrolase family 1 carbohydrate binding module connected via a linker region to a domain with yet unknown function After cloning and expression of Cip1 in H jecorina , the protein was purified and biochemically characterised with the aim of determining a potential enzymatic activity for the novel protein No hydrolytic activity against any of the tested plant cell wall components was found The proteolytic core domain of Cip1 was then crystallised , and the three-dimensional structure of this was determined to 1 5 resolution utilising sulphur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing \( sulphor-SAD \) A calcium ion binding site was identified in a sequence conserved region of Cip1 and is also seen in other proteins with the same general fold as Cip1 , such as many carbohydrate binding modules The presence of this ion was found to have a structural role The Cip1 structure was analysed and a structural homology search was performed to identify structurally related proteins The two published structures with highest overall structural similarity to Cip1 found were two poly-lyases CsGL , a glucuronan lyase from H jecorina and vAL-1 , an alginate lyase from the Chlorella virus This indicates that Cip1 may be a lyase However , initial trials did not detect significant lyase activity for Cip1 Cip1 is the first structure to be solved of the 23 currently known Cip1 sequential homologs \( with a sequence identity cut-off of 25 \) , including both bacterial and fungal members","24039705 20130917 PLoS ONE D016428 D013485 The crystal structure of the core

allele Forty-eight mRNAs were found to change significantly in translation state following release from alpha-factor arrest , including genes involved in pheromone response and cell cycle arrest such as BAR1 , SST2 , and FAR1 After the shift of the cdc15-2 strain from 37 degrees C to 25 degrees C , 54 mRNAs were altered in translation state , including the products of the stress genes HSP82 , HSC82 , and SSA2 Thus , regulation at the translational level seems to play a significant role in the response of yeast cells to external physical or biological cues In contrast , surprisingly few genes were found to be translationally controlled as cells progressed through the cell cycle Additional refinements of TSAA should allow characterization of both transcriptional and translational

biological model , cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cell cycle-arrested using either alpha-factor or the temperature-sensitive cdc15-2 allele Forty-eight mRNAs were found to change significantly in translation state following release from alpha-factor arrest , including genes involved in pheromone response and cell cycle arrest such as BAR1 , SST2 , and FAR1 After the shift of the cdc15-2 strain from 37 degrees C to 25 degrees C , 54 mRNAs were altered in translation state , including the products of the stress genes HSP82 , HSC82 , and SSA2 Thus , regulation at the translational level seems to play a significant role in the response of yeast cells to external physical or biological cues In contrast , surprisingly few genes were found to be translationally controlled as cells progressed through the cell cycle Additional refinements of TSAA should allow characterization of both transcriptional and translational regulatory networks on a genomic scale , providing an additional layer of information that can be integrated into models of system biology and

domain reduced guanine nucleotide binding affinity , hence it blocked the transport of vesicles required for targeting and fusion to the plasma membrane The inhibitory levels of cell growth and GA secretion were correlated with the dosage of SEC4 \( S28N \) gene In addition , overexpression of SEC4 driven by AOX1 promoter in MSPGA-7 improved the secretory production of GA , but demonstrated the delay of cell growth by increased gene dosage of SEC4 Interestingly , a limited level of Sec4p did not disturb the cell growth It was because expression of only one copy of SEC4 resulted in delay of cell growth at an early stage while still maintaining high level Sec4p at long-term incubation Accordingly , as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter was used to substitute AOX1 promoter

be achieved with a cassette placed in the 3' half of its coding region due to the overlap of its sequence with the promoter of the essential gene YlTFC1 The Yltps1 mutant grew in glucose although the

gene duplications In mosquito species we have identified 14 -glucosidase \( Aglu \) genes of which only five have been biochemically characterized so far , two are putative pseudogenes and the rest remains uncharacterized We also revealed quite a complex evolutionary history of the eukaryotic -glucosidases probably involving multiple losses of genes or horizontal gene transfer from

carbon and energy for growth We also developed tools for directed gene disruptions in C japonicus and used this system to construct a mutant in the gspD gene , which is predicted to encode a component of the type II secretion system The gspD pJGG1 mutant displayed a greater-than-2-fold decrease in endoglucanase secretion compared to wild-type C japonicus In addition , the mutant strain showed a pronounced growth defect in medium with biomass as a carbon source , yielding 100-fold fewer viable cells than the wild type To test the potential of C japonicus to undergo metabolic engineering , we constructed a strain able to produce small amounts of ethanol from biomass Collectively , these data suggest that C japonicus is a useful platform for biomass conversion and biofuel

its acid metabolite were investigated using reversed phase HPLC-MS MS , while the enantiomeric ratios were measured by HPLC-MS MS using a Chiralcel OD-H HPLC column Some soil enzymes activities were

approximate square root first-order kinetics \( R 0 98 \) without lag phases The enantiomers of metalaxyl have different elimination rates , with half-lives ranging from only 0 8 to 1 5 days After application to soil , the elimination of metalaxyl in the copper containing formulation was slower The activities of acid phosphatase , alkaline phosphatase , and alkaline glucosidase were monitored

\( 2 \) increased the microbial metabolism of cellulose and chitin , whereas elevated O \( 3 \) dampened this response We hypothesized that this change in metabolism under CO \( 2 \) and O \( 3 \)

Rhinelander , Wisconsin , in which Populus tremuloides , Betula papyrifera , and Acer saccharum were grown under factorial CO \( 2 \) and O \( 3 \) treatments We employed extracellular enzyme analysis to assay microbial metabolism , phospholipid fatty acid \( PLFA \) analysis to determine changes in microbial community composition , and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis \( PCR-DGGE \) to analyze the fungal community composition The activities of 1 , 4-beta-glucosidase \( 37 \) and 1 , 4 , -beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase \( 84 \) were significantly

or O \( 3 \) on fungal relative abundance , as measured by PLFA We identified 39 fungal taxonomic units from soil using DGGE , and found that O \( 3 \) enrichment significantly altered fungal community composition We conclude that fungal metabolism is altered under elevated CO \( 2 \) and O \( 3 \) , and that there was a concomitant change in fungal community composition under elevated O

activity of the hydrolytic enzymes and micromorphology of the fungus using a computerized image analysis system In addition , the phenomenon of autolysis was associated with high concentrations of reactive oxygen species \( ROS \) The accumulation of ROS produced during fermentation causes oxidative stress in B trispora Oxidative stress was examined in terms of the activities of two key defensive enzymes catalase \( CAT \) and superoxide dismutase \( SOD \) The profile of the specific activities of the above enzymes appeared to correlate with the oxidative stress of the fungus The high activities of CAT and SOD showed that B trispora is found under oxidative stress during beta-carotene production The culture began to show signs of autolysis nearly in the growth phase and autolysis increased significantly during the production phase The morphological differentiation of the fungus was a result of the degradation of the cell membrane by hydrolytic enzymes and oxidative

activity of trehalase , within the first minutes of spore germination The activation was transient after reaching a maximum between 5 and 10 min , the activity declined back to low values during the next hours The increase in trehalase activity was not inhibited by cycloheximide or by anaerobic conditions The decline in trehalase activity that occurred after the initial activation could be correlated with the extent of trehalose breakdown as measured by \( 13 \) C NMR In addition to the increase in trehalase activity , differences in the control properties were found between the enzymes from dormant and germinating spores Trehalase from dormant spores was strongly inhibited by ATP at a concentration of approximately 0 5 mM , which corresponds with the ATP concentration found in dormant spores On the other hand , trehalase from germinating spores was not inhibited by ATP up to the much higher ATP concentrations that are found in germinating spores It is suggested that the low activity and the stringent ATP feedback inhibition of trehalase from dormant spores are responsible for the very slow mobilization of the huge amount of trehalose in dormant spores Therefore , dormancy seems to be caused primarily by extreme curtailment of the energy production within the spore at one selective and primary point The switch towards high activity and low ATP inhibition upon induction of germination is suggested to be responsible for the breaking of dormancy and for the rapid breakdown of trehalose that occurs during the initial phase of germination","6954495 19820601

stringent ATP feedback inhibition of trehalase from dormant spores are responsible for the very slow mobilization of the huge amount of trehalose in dormant spores Therefore , dormancy seems to be caused primarily by extreme curtailment of the energy production within the spore at one selective and primary point The switch towards high activity and low ATP inhibition upon induction of germination is suggested to be responsible for the breaking of dormancy and for the rapid breakdown of trehalose that occurs during the initial phase of germination",G0000000|G0000000|C1418943|G0000000|C0268596|C3642273|G0000000|C0565930|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0392747|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|C0871161|G0000000|C0040814|G0000000|C1279919|C0242735|G0000000|C0036025|C0521061|C1707520|G0000000|C0040815|C0443161|G0000000|C0557651|G0000000|G0000000|C1515655|G0000000|C0024485|G0000000|C0851285|G0000000|C0040815|C0443161|G0000000|C0678686|G0000000|G0000000|C0205263|G0000000|C0242735|G0000000|C0036025|C0521061|G0000000|C0557651|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1515655|C1719039|C0024485|C0037812|G0000000|G0000000|C1533691|C0005507|G0000000|C0040814|C0205177|C0205296|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0024485|C1883073|C1883727|G0000000|G0000000|C0205263|G0000000|C0242735|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C0031603|C1547282|G0000000|C0456962|C0443161|G0000000|C0449719|G0000000|G0000000|C0040815|C0423896|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C0031603|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205289|C0040815|C0443161|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0024485|C1883073|C1547282|G0000000|G0000000|C0205101|C1524062|C0017725|G0000000|G0000000|C0205102|C0040815|G0000000|C1524026|G0000000|C0040363|C0017861|G0000000|C0001962|G0000000|G0000000|C0012634|G0000000|C0028158|C0871712|G0000000|C0443225|C0242735|G0000000|C1518422|C0332149|G0000000|C0040815|C0443161|C1272691|G0000000|C0332232|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040815|C1709305|G0000000|C0017861|G0000000|C0001962|C0033268|G0000000|G0000000|C0205101|C0017725|C0549178|G0000000|C0439855|C0009458|G0000000|C0443225|C0038027|C0242735|G0000000|C1709305|G0000000|C0040815|C0443161|G0000000|C0205172|G0000000|C0242485|G0000000|C0040814|C0205177|G0000000|C0038027|C2828366|C1881534|G0000000|C0332287|G0000000|G0000000|C1265611|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C0031603|C0040363|G0000000|C0038027|C0443289|G0000000|C1276802|C0450371|C0442805|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|C0040814|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205435|C0439232|G0000000|C0038027|C0242735|G0000000|C1879547|G0000000|C0040704|G0000000|C2584321|G0000000|C0806909|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0702093|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|C0004600|C0040363|C0205251|C0042295|G0000000|G0000000|C0205117|C0439227|G0000000|C0442805|G0000000|C0040814|C0205177|G0000000|C1518422|C0311403|G0000000|C0010572|G0000000|G0000000|C3641081|C0012634|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040814|C0205177|G0000000|C1709305|G0000000|G0000000|C0205265|C1879547|G0000000|G0000000|C1707520|G0000000|G0000000|C0439792|G0000000|C0040815|C0443161|G0000000|C0444706|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0024485|G0000000|C0332287|C0040363|G0000000|C0442805|G0000000|C0040814|C0205177|G0000000|C1705241|G0000000|G0000000|C0243148|C0871161|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C0678686|G0000000|G0000000|C0038027|C0040814|G0000000|C0678686|C0038027|G0000000|G0000000|C0311403|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0004268|G0000000|C0332232|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0004268|C0150312|G0000000|C0678686|C0038027|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0018563|G0000000|C0040814|G0000000|G0000000|C0038027|G0000000|C1518422|C0311403|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C0205393|C0205250|G0000000|C0086045|G0000000|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0038027|G0000000|G0000000|C1705535|G0000000|G0000000|C0205251|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0015744|C0021467|G0000000|C0040814|G0000000|C0678686|C0038027|G0000000|C1273518|G0000000|G0000000|C0442824|C0439834|C0185112|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1265611|G0000000|C0040815|G0000000|C0678686|C0038027|G0000000|G0000000|C0678686|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C0015127|G0000000|G0000000|C0205403|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0424589|C0033268|G0000000|G0000000|C0038027|G0000000|C0205447|C0036576|G0000000|C0205225|C1552961|G0000000|C1707719|G0000000|C0205250|C0205177|G0000000|C0205251|G0000000|C0021467|G0000000|C0205263|G0000000|C0242735|G0000000|C1705535|C0040363|G0000000|C1273518|G0000000|G0000000|C1881704|G0000000|C0678686|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0456962|C0443161|G0000000|C0040815|G0000000|C1709305|G0000000|G0000000|C0205265|C0205390|G0000000|C0242735

"22132933 20111203 J Food Sci D003160 D016428 Heat and pH stability of alkali-extractable corn arabinoxylan and its xylanase-hydrolyzate and their viscosity behavior In in vitro batch fermentations , both alkali-extractable corn arabinoxylan \( CAX \) and its xylanase-hydrolyzate \( CH \) were utilized by human fecal microbiota and produced similar short chain fatty acid \( SCFA \) contents and desirable long fermentation profiles with low initial gas production Fortification of these arabinoxylans into processed foods would contribute desirable dietary fiber benefits to humans Heat and pH stability , as well as viscosity behavior of CAX and CH were investigated Size exclusion chromatography was used to analyze the molecular size distribution after treatment at different pH 's and heating temperatures for different time periods Treated under boiling and pressure cooking conditions at pH 3 , CAX was degraded to a smaller molecular size , whereas the molecular size of the CH showed only a minor decrease CAX and CH were mostly stable at neutral pH , except when CAX was treated under pressure for 60 min that slightly lowered molecular size At 37 C , neither CAX nor CH was adversely affected by treatment at low or neutral pH The viscosities of solutions containing 5 and 10 of CAX were 48 7 and 637 0 mPa s , respectively that were higher than those of solutions containing 5 and 10 of its hydrolyzate at shear rate 1 s The CAX solutions showed Newtonian flow behavior , whereas shear-thinning behavior was observed in CH solutions In conclusion , the hydrolyzate of CAX has potential to be used in high fiber drinks due to its favorable fermentation properties , higher pH and heat stability , lower and shear-thinning viscosity , and lighter color than the native CAX Arabinoxylan extracted by an alkali from corn bran is a soluble fiber with a desirable low initial and extended fermentation property Corn arabinoxylan hydrolyzate using an endoxylanase was much more stable at different levels of acidity and heat than the native arabinoxylan , and showed lower solution viscosity and shear-thinning property that indicates its potential as an alternative

"23220961 20121211 Appl Environ Microbiol D016428 D013485 Microbial mechanisms mediating increased soil C storage under elevated atmospheric N deposition Future rates of anthropogenic N deposition can slow the cycling and enhance the storage of C in forest ecosystems In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem , experimental N deposition has decreased the extent of forest floor decay , leading to increased soil C storage To better understand the microbial mechanisms mediating this response , we examined the functional genes derived from communities of actinobacteria and fungi present in the

common and abundant root-colonizing fungi in the native tallgrass prairie To characterize DSE fungi were isolated from roots of mixed tallgrass prairie plant communities Isolates were grouped according to morphology , and the grouping was refined by ITS-RFLP and or sequencing of the ITS region Sporulating species of Periconia , Fusarium , Microdochium and Aspergillus were isolated along

of lipase activity in comparison with maximal activity at 30 degrees C \) , alkalophilicity of both proteins \( elastase shows the alkaline optimal pH equal to 8 at pH 9 preserves 97 activity , and at pH 10 94 activity , respectively while lipase prefers the pH 10 and at pH 8 and pH 9 enzyme keeps 57 and 60 activity , respectively \) as well as lack of repression by suitable substrates Sigmoid character of curve concerning pH influence on the activity of both enzymes , also indicates similarity between elastase and lipase On minor part of NAGase and chitobiosidase of fungus C coronatus in perforation of coats of host body showed high sensibility of both enzymes on hydrogen ions concentration both enzymes prefer neutral pH , in pH 6 and 8 lose over 35 activity but subjection to substrate repression and 3-4-fold growth of activity followed only in 30 degrees C In the course of work it was found , that rich medium \( LB \) stimulates growth of mycelium and production of fungal lipases So far nobody managed to isolate chitinolytic or lipolytic enzymes from C coronatus homogenate The majority of fungal enzymes were isolated from post incubation filtrates In the literature of the subject lack of data about C coronatus NAGase , therefore in examinations also the trial of isolation NAGase from C coronatus homogenate was undertaken Activity of NAGase showed only first fraction , which did not separate with none of used columns Disappointing results of purification on cation exchanger CM , weak anion exchanger DEAE , and strong anion exchanger Q were obtained as well as after fractionation tests with the use of Microcon microcolumns In aim of NAGase molecular mass estimation , two zymograms were made with Triton X-100 and casein and with the use of fluorescent substrate 4-Methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide Molecular mass of NAGase from C coronatus was established on ca 60 kDa This is the first report describing molecular weight of NAGase from C coronatus Examined NAGase has different properties than known NAGases from other entomopathogenic fungi Although its molecular weight is equal to the Metarhizium anisopliae NAGase , optimal pH for both NAGases are different neutral in the case of C coronatus NAGase versus acidic in the case of M anisopliae NAGase Knowledge of molecular mass of the C coronatus NAGase should allow to find a new method of this enzyme isolation from C coronatus homogenate Thanks to developed methods of assaying activities of elastase , NAGase , chitobiosidase and lipase , real becomes the

\( 4 \) OH \( 0 5 g NH \( 4 \) OH of a 28 v v per gram dry biomass 160 degrees C , 60 min \) , and composition analysis showed that the glucan and xylan fractions remained largely intact The enzyme activities of four commercial xylanase preparations and supernatants of four laboratory-grown fungi were determined and evaluated for their ability to boost xylan hydrolysis when added to cellulase and beta-glucosidase \( 10 filter paper units FPU 20 cellobiase units CBU g glucan \) At 1 glucan loading , the commercial enzyme preparations \( added at 10 or 50 levels of total protein in the enzyme preparations \) boosted xylan and glucan hydrolysis in both pretreated bagasse samples Xylanase addition at 10 protein level also improved hydrolysis of xylan and glucan fractions up to 10 glucan loading \( 28 solids loading \) Significant xylanase activity in enzyme cocktails appears to be required for improving hydrolysis of both glucan and xylan fractions of ammonia pretreated sugar

Interestingly , in contrast to previous reports , we found that some fungi such as Melanocarpus albomyces readily grew on crystalline cellulose and produced cellulases These results indicate that there are large differences in the cellulolytic potential of different isolates of the same species Furthermore , all the selected species were able to degrade cellulose but the differences in cellulolytic potential and thermostability of the secretome did not correlate to the taxonomic position PCR amplification and sequencing of 22 cellulase genes from the fungi showed that the level of

isolates of the same species Furthermore , all the selected species were able to degrade cellulose but the differences in cellulolytic potential and thermostability of the secretome did not correlate to the taxonomic position PCR amplification and sequencing of 22 cellulase genes from the fungi showed that the level of thermostability of the cellulose-degrading activity could not be inferred from the phylogenetic relationship of the cellulases",G0000000|G0000000|C0002679|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3245505|G0000000|C0597570|C1705920|G0000000|C0205450|C0016832|C3244315|G0000000|G0000000|C0016832|C0005535|C0243125|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0162340|G0000000|C0031227|G0000000|C0005532|C0520510|G0000000|C0349590|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0021267|C0005535|C0439836|G0000000|C0332185|C0439234|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0442808|C0543488|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0005532|C0035820|G0000000|C0597570|C0016832|G0000000|G0000000|C1880022|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3827682|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|C0150312|C0557651|G0000000|C1292732|G0000000|G0000000|C3245505|G0000000|C0450371|C0597570|C0016832|G0000000|G0000000|C0205449|C0003965|C3244315|C0600440|G0000000|C0997424|G0000000|C0600439|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0319495|C1705175|C0026717|G0000000|C0180153|G0000000|C0016832|C3244315|G0000000|C0332257|C0597570|C0597570|C0016832|G0000000|G0000000|C0205171|C1552738|C0684063|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0039476|C1282910|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0016832|G0000000|C0085732|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0444626|C0007648|G0000000|G0000000|C1327616|C0014442|C1547282|G0000000|C1705242|G0000000|C0441655|G0000000|C0450407|C2698651|G0000000|C0597571|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0009924|C0040363|C0205156|C0684224|G0000000|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0016832|G0000000|G0000000|C1054015|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0444626|C0007648|G0000000|G0000000|C1260229|G0000000|C1274040|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0549177|C1705241|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3245505|G0000000|C1705242|C1764827|G0000000|G0000000|C0445247|C1705920|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1707391|C1705920|G0000000|C0085732|C0040363|G0000000|C0007648|G0000000|G0000000|C1705241|G0000000|G0000000|C3245505|G0000000|C0597571|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1518422|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C0008903|C0733755|C0032520|C1517480|G0000000|C1294197|G0000000|C0450371|C0007641|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|C0016832|C1547282|G0000000|G0000000|C0441889|G0000000|C0597571|G0000000|G0000000|C0007648|C0205177|G0000000|C1518422|G0000000|C0679201|G0000000|G0000000|C0031797|C0439849|G0000000|G0000000|C1260229

cellulase-hyperproducing mutant of Trichoderma koningii , and address whether enzyme production can be further improved by silencing the cre1 gene cre1 partially silenced strains were constructed to improve enzyme production in T koningii YC01 , a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant Silencing of cre1 resulted in derepression of cellulase gene expression in glucose-based cultivation The cre1 interference strain C313 produced 2 1- , 1 4- , 0 8- , and 0 8-fold higher amounts of filter paper activity , -1 , 4-exoglucanase activity \( -nitrophenyl- -D-cellobioside as substrate \) , -1 , 4-endoglucanase activity \( sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as substrate \) , and xylanase activity , respectively , than the control strain , suggesting that silencing of cre1 resulted in enhanced

cellulase production The cellulase and xylanase genes of filamentous Trichoderma fungi exist under carbon catabolite repression mediated by the regulator carbon catabolite repressor \( CREI \) Our objective was to find the role of CREI in a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant of Trichoderma koningii , and address whether enzyme production can be further improved by silencing the cre1 gene cre1 partially silenced strains were constructed to improve enzyme production in T koningii YC01 , a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant Silencing of cre1 resulted in derepression of cellulase gene expression in glucose-based cultivation The cre1 interference strain C313 produced 2 1- , 1 4- , 0 8- , and 0 8-fold higher amounts of filter paper activity , -1 , 4-exoglucanase activity \( -nitrophenyl- -D-cellobioside as substrate \) , -1 , 4-endoglucanase activity \( sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as substrate \) , and xylanase activity , respectively , than the control strain , suggesting that

"23167779 20121122 FEBS J D016428 D013485 Xylanase XYN IV from Trichoderma reesei showing exo- and endo-xylanase activity A minor xylanase , named XYN IV , was purified from the cellulolytic system of the fungus Trichoderma reesei Rut C30 The enzyme was discovered on the basis of its ability to attack aldotetraohexenuronic acid \( HexA-2Xyl-4Xyl-4Xyl , HexA \( 3 \) Xyl \( 3 \) \) , releasing the reducing-end xylose residue XYN IV exhibited catalytic properties incompatible with previously described endo- -1 , 4-xylanases of this fungus , XYN I , XYN II and XYN III , and the xylan-hydrolyzing endo- -1 , 4-glucanase EG I XYN IV was able to degrade several different -1 , 4-xylans , but was inactive on -1 , 4-mannans and -1 , 4-glucans It showed both exo-and endo-xylanase activity Rhodymenan , a linear soluble -1 , 3- -1 , 4-xylan , was as the best substrate Linear xylooligosaccharides were attacked exclusively at the first glycosidic linkage from the reducing end The gene xyn4 , encoding XYN IV , was also isolated It showed clear homology with xylanases classified in glycoside hydrolase family 30 , which also includes glucanases and mannanases The xyn4 gene was expressed slightly when grown on xylose and xylitol , clearly on arabinose , arabitol , sophorose , xylobiose , xylan and cellulose , but not on glucose or sorbitol , resembling induction of other xylanolytic enzymes from T reesei A recombinant enzyme prepared in a Pichia pastoris expression system exhibited identical catalytic properties to the enzyme isolated from the T reesei culture medium The physiological role of

determinants","23167779 20121122 FEBS J D016428 D013485 Xylanase XYN IV from Trichoderma reesei showing exo- and endo-xylanase activity A minor xylanase , named XYN IV , was purified from the cellulolytic system of the fungus Trichoderma reesei Rut C30 The enzyme was discovered on the basis of its ability to attack aldotetraohexenuronic acid \( HexA-2Xyl-4Xyl-4Xyl , HexA \( 3 \) Xyl \( 3 \) \) , releasing the reducing-end xylose residue XYN IV exhibited catalytic properties incompatible with previously described endo- -1 , 4-xylanases of this fungus , XYN I , XYN II and XYN III , and the xylan-hydrolyzing endo- -1 , 4-glucanase EG I XYN IV was able to degrade several different -1 , 4-xylans , but was inactive on -1 , 4-mannans and -1 , 4-glucans It showed both exo-and endo-xylanase activity Rhodymenan , a linear soluble -1 , 3- -1 , 4-xylan , was as the best substrate Linear xylooligosaccharides were attacked exclusively at the first glycosidic linkage from the reducing end The gene xyn4 , encoding XYN IV , was also isolated It showed clear homology with xylanases classified in glycoside hydrolase family 30 , which also includes glucanases and mannanases The xyn4 gene was expressed slightly when grown on xylose and xylitol , clearly on arabinose , arabitol , sophorose , xylobiose , xylan and cellulose , but not on glucose or sorbitol , resembling induction of other xylanolytic enzymes from T reesei A recombinant enzyme prepared in a Pichia pastoris expression system exhibited identical catalytic properties to the enzyme isolated from the T reesei culture medium The physiological role of this unique enzyme remains unknown , but it may involve liberation of xylose from the reducing end of branched oligosaccharides that are resistant

"18944733 20081024 Phytopathology D016428 A Corn Trypsin Inhibitor with Antifungal Activity Inhibits Aspergillus flavus alpha-Amylase ABSTRACT In this study , we found that the inhibition of fungal growth in potato dextrose broth \( PDB \) medium by the 14-kDa corn trypsin inhibitor \( TI \) protein , previously found to be associated with host resistance to aflatoxin production and active against various fungi , was relieved when exogenous alpha-amylase was added along with TI No inhibitory effect of TI on fungal growth was observed when Aspergillus flavus was grown on a medium containing either 5 glucose or 1 gelatin as a carbon source Further investigation found that TI not only inhibited fungal production of extracellular alpha-amylase when A flavus was grown in PDB medium containing TI at 100 mug ml \( -1 \) but also reduced the enzymatic activity of A flavus alpha-amylase by 27 At a higher concentration , however , TI stimulated the production of alpha-amylase The effect of TI on the production of amyloglucosidase , another enzyme involved in starch metabolism by the fungus , was quite different It stimulated the production of this enzyme during the first 10 h at all concentrations studied These studies suggest that the resistance of certain corn genotypes to A flavus infection may be partially due to the ability of TI to reduce the production of extracellular fungal alpha-amylase and its activity , thereby limiting the availability of simple sugars for fungal growth However , further investigation of the relationship between TI levels and fungal alpha-amylase expression in vivo is needed","18944733 20081024 Phytopathology D016428 A Corn Trypsin Inhibitor with Antifungal Activity Inhibits Aspergillus flavus alpha-Amylase ABSTRACT In

We have investigated the effect of disruption of the bgl1- \( beta-glucosidase l-encoding \) gene of Trichoderma reesei on the formation of other beta-glucosidase activities and on the induction of cellulases To this end the bgl1 locus was disrupted by insertion of the Aspergillus nidulans amdS \( acetamidase-encoding \) gene The bgl1-disrupted strain did not produce the 75 kDa extracellular beta-glucosidase on cellulose or lactose , but still formed beta-glucosidase activity on glucose , cellobiose , xylan or beta-1 , 3-glucan , suggesting that the enzyme \( s \) exhibiting this beta-glucosidase activity is \( are \) not encoded by bgl1 The cellulase-inducer sophorose induced the bgl1-encoded beta-glucosidase , whereas the remaining beta-glucosidase activity was induced by

the bgl1-disrupted strain The multicopy strain and the parent strain were comparably efficient at saturating sophorose concentrations The beta-glucosidase inhibitor nojirimycin strongly inhibited induction in all strains These data suggest that the bgl1-encoded beta-glucosidase is not identical to the plasma-membrane-bound , constitutive , methyl-beta-glucoside inducible beta-glucosidase , but

oats spelts xylan as respective carbon substrates Xylanase production by this fungus was greatly affected by the culture pH , with pH 7 5 resulting in a high extracellular xylanase activity in the SSL-based medium as well as in a complex medium with xylan as carbon substrate This effect , therefore , was not solely due to growth inhibition at the lower pH values by the acetic acid in the SSL The xylanase activity in the SSL medium peaked at 199 U ml \( -1 \) at pH 7 5 with a corresponding maximum specific growth rate of 0 39 h \( -1 \) By contrast , the maximum extracellular beta-xylosidase activity pf 0 36 U ml \( -1 \) was recorded at pH 4 0 Three low molecular weight xylanase isozymes were secreted at all pH values within the range of pH 4-8 , whereas cellulase activity on both carbon substrates was negligible Impeller tip velocities within the range of 1 56-3 12 m s \( -1 \) had no marked effect , either on the xylanase activity , or on the maximum volumetric rate of xylanase production These results also demonstrated that SSL constituted a suitable carbon feedstock as well as inducer for xylanase production in aerobic submerged culture by this

"19962399 20091208 Plasmid D016428 Stable high level expression of the violacein indolocarbazole anti-tumour gene cluster and the Streptomyces lividans amyA gene in E coli K12 Previous studies showed that when pPSX-vioABCDE was used to transform E coli K12 DH5alpha the strain retained the plasmid even after 100 generations of unselected growth but produced a low level of the anti-tumour antibiotic

unstable regardless of presence or absence of antibiotic selection to retain the plasmid The current study was undertaken to determine if strains of E coli K12 could be isolated which stably over produce violacein When a range of E coli K12 strains were transformed with pPSX-vioABCDE , most produced small amounts of violacein However , a small number of related strains of E coli K12 JM101 , JM105 and JM109 not only over-produced violacein , but also maintained the high stability In addition , E coli K12 JM109 strongly expressed an alpha amylase gene \( amyA \) from Streptomyces lividans

recruit the Swi Snf complex to the STA1 promoter Next , the Swi Snf complex enhances Flo8 and Mss11 binding to UAS1-2 In the final step , Flo8 and Mss11 directly promote association of RNA polymerase II with the STA1 promoter to activate STA1 expression In the absence of glucose , the levels of Flo8 and Tec1 are greatly increased , whereas the abundances of two repressors , Nrg1 and Sfl1 , are reduced , suggesting that the balance of transcriptional regulators may be important for determining activation or repression of STA1 expression",G0000000|G0000000|C0027960|C0007634|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2949735|G0000000|G0000000|C1335840|C1548534|C0439855|G0000000|G0000000|C0033414|C0086597|C1879547|G0000000|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|C0036025|C0036024|G0000000|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|C2700640|G0000000|C0521119|C0015278|G0000000|G0000000|C1879547|G0000000|G0000000|C0205369|C1148673|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1335840|C1548534|C0008546|C0439855|G0000000|G0000000|C1547282|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1145667|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C0443241|C0205341|C0004793|C0369718|G0000000|C0369718|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0086860|G0000000|C0332287|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1145667|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0086860|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1145667|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1269955|C0871261|C0013879|G0000000|C1414819|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2607943|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1335840|C1548534|C0439855|C1145667|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0086860|G0000000|G0000000|C0332283|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1145667|C0205435|C0040363|G0000000|C1414819|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1335840|C1548534|C0439855|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0086860|C0205117|G0000000|G0000000|C1335840|C1548534|C0439855|C2349975|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1145667|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205088|C1261552|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1947931|C0033414|C0004083|G0000000|C0035668|C1335439|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0086860|C0040363|C1515877|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|G0000000|C0332197|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|G0000000|C0441889|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3840786|C0205217|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2346714|G0000000|C0205448|C1336789|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0392756|G0000000|C1705535|G0000000|G0000000|C0014653|G0000000|C0040649|C0182953|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1879547|G0000000|C0035143|G0000000|G0000000|C0185117

conservative ones \( Ile39 , Ser86 , Ser137 , Ile152 , Ile159 and Leu223 \) were identified A set of 70 representative PMEs was created The sequences were aligned and the evolutionary tree based on the alignment was calculated The tree reflected the taxonomy the fungal and bacterial PMEs formed their own clusters and the plant enzymes were grouped into eight separate clades The plant PME from Vitis riparia was placed in a common clade with fungi Three plant clades \( Plant 1 , 2 and 3 \) were relatively homogenous reflecting high degree of mutual sequence identity The clade Plant 4 contained PMEs from flower parts \( mostly form pollen \) and was heterogenous , like the clades Plant 1a and 2a , which moreover exhibit an intermediate character The clades Plant X1 and X2 were situated in the tree close to microbial clades and represented atypical plant PMEs Taking into account the remaining plant PMEs , an expanded plant alignment and tree \( with most Arabidopsis thaliana

segment containing basic dipeptide , R \( K \) R \( K \) , that precedes the N-terminal end of PME was revealed This was not observed in the clade Plant X1 and majority of the clade Plant X2 This

-amylase as an alternative technique The effects of operational parameters such as pressure \( 50-300 bar \) , temperature \( 28-80 C \) , CO flow \( 2-10 g min \) and time \( 60-180 min \) were evaluated in regard to the activity and stability of fungal based -amylase from Aspergillus oryzea The activity of untreated enzyme was determined as 17 , 726 mol ml min While both sub- and supercritical conditions enhanced the activity , the increase in flow rate had an adverse effect and the activity was decreased by 28 9 at a flow rate of 10 g min under supercritical conditions Nuclear magnetic resonance \( NMR \) spectra of untreated enzyme and treated samples exhibiting the lowest and the highest activities were almost identical except for the chemical shifts observed at the lowest activity sample from 4 0 to 4 4 ppm which were assigned to protons of hydrogen-bonded groups Optimum conditions were determined as 240 bar , 41 C , 4 g min CO flow and 150 min of process

deconstruction are a major cost in the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass The goal of this research was to develop optimized synthetic mixtures of enzymes for multiple pretreatment substrate combinations using our high-throughput biomass digestion platform , GENPLAT , which combines robotic liquid handling , statistical experimental design and automated Glc and Xyl assays Proportions of six core fungal enzymes \( CBH1 , CBH2 , EG1 , -glucosidase , a GH10 endo- 1 , 4-xylanase , and -xylosidase \) were optimized at a fixed enzyme loading of 15 mg g glucan for release of Glc and Xyl from all combinations of five biomass feedstocks \( corn stover , switchgrass , Miscanthus , dried distillers' grains plus solubles DDGS and poplar \) subjected to three alkaline pretreatments \( AFEX , dilute base 0 25 NaOH and alkaline peroxide AP \) A 16-component mixture comprising the core set plus 10 accessory enzymes was optimized for three pretreatment substrate combinations Results were compared to the performance of two commercial enzymes \( Accellerase 1000 and Spezyme CP \) at the same protein loadings When analyzed with GENPLAT , corn stover gave the highest yields of Glc with commercial enzymes and with the core set with all pretreatments , whereas corn stover , switchgrass and Miscanthus gave comparable Xyl yields With commercial enzymes and with the core set , yields of Glc and Xyl were highest for grass stovers pretreated by AP compared to AFEX or dilute base Corn stover , switchgrass and DDGS pretreated with AFEX and digested with the core set required a higher proportion of endo- 1 , 4-xylanase \( EX3 \) and a lower proportion of endo- 1 , 4-glucanase \( EG1 \) compared to the same materials pretreated with dilute base or AP An optimized enzyme mixture containing 16 components \( by addition of -glucuronidase , a GH11 endoxylanase EX2 , Cel5A , Cel61A , Cip1 , Cip2 , -mannanase , amyloglucosidase , -arabinosidase , and Cel12A to the core set \) was determined for AFEX-pretreated corn stover , DDGS , and AP-pretreated corn stover The optimized mixture for AP-corn stover contained more exo- 1 , 4-glucanase \( i e , the sum of CBH1 CBH2 \) and less endo- 1 , 4-glucanase \( EG1 Cel5A \) than the optimal mixture for AFEX-corn stover Amyloglucosidase and -mannanase were the two most important enzymes for release of Glc from DDGS but were not required \( i e , 0 optimum \) for corn stover subjected to AP or AFEX As a function of enzyme loading over the range 0 to 30 mg g glucan , Glc release from AP-corn stover reached a plateau of 60-70 Glc yield at a lower enzyme loading \( 5-10 mg g glucan \) than AFEX-corn stover Accellerase 1000 was superior to Spezyme CP , the core set or the 16-component mixture for Glc yield at 12 h , but the 16-component set was as effective as the commercial enzyme mixtures at 48 h The results in this paper demonstrate that GENPLAT can be used to rapidly produce enzyme cocktails for specific pretreatment biomass combinations Pretreatment conditions and feedstock source both influence the Glc and Xyl yields as well as optimal enzyme proportions It is predicted that

dried distillers' grains plus solubles DDGS and poplar \) subjected to three alkaline pretreatments \( AFEX , dilute base 0 25 NaOH and alkaline peroxide AP \) A 16-component mixture comprising the core set plus 10 accessory enzymes was optimized for three pretreatment substrate combinations Results were compared to the performance of two commercial enzymes \( Accellerase 1000 and Spezyme CP \) at the same protein loadings When analyzed with GENPLAT , corn stover gave the highest yields of Glc with commercial enzymes and with the core set with all pretreatments , whereas corn stover , switchgrass and Miscanthus gave comparable Xyl yields With commercial enzymes and with the core set , yields of Glc and Xyl were highest for grass stovers pretreated by AP compared to AFEX or dilute base Corn stover , switchgrass and DDGS pretreated with AFEX and digested with the core set required a higher proportion of endo- 1 , 4-xylanase \( EX3 \) and a lower proportion of endo- 1 , 4-glucanase \( EG1 \) compared to the same materials pretreated with dilute base or AP An optimized enzyme mixture containing 16 components \( by addition of -glucuronidase , a GH11 endoxylanase EX2 , Cel5A , Cel61A , Cip1 , Cip2 , -mannanase , amyloglucosidase , -arabinosidase , and Cel12A to the core set \) was determined for AFEX-pretreated corn stover , DDGS , and AP-pretreated corn stover The optimized mixture for AP-corn stover contained more exo- 1 , 4-glucanase \( i e , the sum of CBH1 CBH2 \) and less endo- 1 , 4-glucanase \( EG1 Cel5A \) than the optimal mixture for AFEX-corn stover Amyloglucosidase and -mannanase were the two most important enzymes for release of Glc from DDGS but were not required \( i e , 0 optimum \) for corn stover subjected to AP or AFEX As a function of enzyme loading over the range 0 to 30 mg g glucan , Glc release from AP-corn stover reached a plateau of 60-70 Glc yield at a lower enzyme loading \( 5-10 mg g glucan \) than AFEX-corn stover Accellerase 1000 was superior to Spezyme CP , the core set or the 16-component mixture for Glc yield at 12 h , but the 16-component set was as effective as the commercial enzyme mixtures at 48 h The results in this paper demonstrate that GENPLAT can be used to rapidly produce enzyme cocktails for specific pretreatment biomass combinations Pretreatment conditions and feedstock source both influence the Glc and Xyl yields as well as optimal enzyme proportions It is predicted that it will be possible to improve synthetic enzyme mixtures further by the addition of additional accessory enzymes",G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2717891|G0000000|C0456962|C2698650|G0000000|C0014442|C0439962|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1880371|C1550147|C0005535|G0000000|C0453882|C0014442|G0000000|C0032098|C0007634|C0677535|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205082|C0010186|G0000000|G0000000|C0033268|G0000000|C0001962|G0000000|G0000000|C0005535|G0000000|C0018017|G0000000|G0000000|C0035168|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C1883254|C0439962|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C0439064|C1550147|C1710236|C0453882|C1524063|G0000000|C0205250|C0005535|C0012238|C1710360|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0336789|C0035785|C0301571|C0018578|G0000000|C0038215|C1517586|C1707689|G0000000|C0205554|C0008556|G0000000|G0000000|C0005507|C1709707|G0000000|C0205452|C0444669|C0016832|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0017764|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0014175|G0000000|G0000000|C0059100|G0000000|G0000000|C0043376|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0443218|C0014442|C1708715|G0000000|C0450371|C0026410|C0439267|C0017696|G0000000|C0030685|G0000000|C0008556|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0453882|G0000000|C0205451|C0005535|G0000000|G0000000|C0010028|G0000000|G0000000|C1007726|G0000000|C1023396|G0000000|C1512080|C0682260|C0086369|C0332287|C1749467|G0000000|G0000000|C0522458|G0000000|C0681850|C0040363|C0205449|C1979842|C1550147|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1720119|C0002055|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C1979842|C0031180|C3887950|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0439962|C2700400|G0000000|C0444669|C0036849|C0332287|C0450371|C2963249|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205449|C1550147|C1710236|C0453882|C1274040|G0000000|C1707455|C0040363|G0000000|C0597198|G0000000|C0205448|C0680536|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C4050020|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0445247|C0033684|C1708715|G0000000|C0936012|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0010028|G0000000|C1947971|G0000000|C1522410|G0000000|G0000000|C0008556|G0000000|C0680536|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0444669|C0036849|G0000000|G0000000|C1550147|G0000000|G0000000|C0010028|G0000000|G0000000|C1007726|G0000000|C1023396|C1947971|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0680536|C0014442|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0444669|C0036849|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0008556|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1522410|G0000000|C0018210|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3887950|C1707455|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C1720119|C0002055|C0010028|G0000000|G0000000|C1007726|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0868946|G0000000|G0000000|C0444669|C0036849|C1514873|G0000000|C0205250|C1709707|G0000000|C0014175|G0000000|G0000000|C0059100|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0441994|C1709707|G0000000|C0014175|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1707455|C0040363|G0000000|C0445247|C0520510|G0000000|G0000000|C1720119|C0002055|G0000000|C3887950|G0000000|G0000000|C0014442|C0439962|C0332256|C0450371|C0449432|G0000000|G0000000|C0332287|G0000000|C0017776|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0059102|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0053413|G0000000|C0015278|G0000000|C0051400|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C0444669|C0036849|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0010028|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3887950|C0010028|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439962|G0000000|C3887950|G0000000|C0332256|C0205172|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0021966|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1515051|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439092|C0014175|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2698651|C0439962|G0000000|C0010028|G0000000|C0015278|G0000000|C0053413|G0000000|G0000000|C0205448|C0205393|G0000000|C0014442|G0000000|C0030685|G0000000|C0008556|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1518422|C1514873|G0000000|C0021966|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2698651|G0000000|G0000000|C0010028|G0000000|C0681850|C0040363|C3887950|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0031843|G0000000|C0014442|C1708715|C0205136|G0000000|C1514721|G0000000|C0040363|C0450371|C0026410|C0439267|C0017696|G0000000|C0008556|C0030685|G0000000|C3887950|G0000000|C2584321|G0000000|C2964353|G0000000|C0450371|C0008556|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0441994|C0014442|C1708715|G0000000|C0450371|C0026410|C0439267|C0017696|G0000000|G0000000|C0010028|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1282910|C0040363|G0000000|C4050020|G0000000|G0000000|C0444669|C0036849|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0439962|G0000000|C0008556|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0033727|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0036849|G0000000|G0000000|C1280519|G0000000|G0000000|C0680536|C0014442|C0439962|G0000000|C0450371|C0033727|G0000000|C1274040|G0000000|G0000000|C0030351|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1273517|C0040363|C0456962|G0000000|C0014442|C0678420|G0000000|C0205369|C1550147|C0005535|C0453882|C1550147|C0012634|G0000000|G0000000|C0449416|G0000000|C4054723|G0000000|C0008556|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000

beta-glucosidase 1 \( bgl1 \) gene was expressed in a lactic-acid-producing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain to enable lactic fermentation with cellobiose The recombinant beta-glucosidase enzyme was expressed on the yeast cell surface by fusing the mature protein to the C-terminal half region of the alpha-agglutinin The beta-glucosidase expression plasmids were integrated into the genome Three strong promoters of S cerevisiae , the TDH3 , PGK1 , and PDC1 promoters , were used for beta-glucosidase expression The specific beta-glucosidase activity varied with the promoter used and the copy number of the bgl1 gene The highest activity was obtained with strain PB2 that possessed two copies of the bgl1 gene driven by the PDC1 promoter PB2 could grow on cellobiose and glucose minimal medium at the same rate Fermentation experiments were conducted in non-selective-rich media containing 95 g l \( -1 \) cellobiose or 100 g l \( -1 \) glucose as a carbon source under microaerobic conditions The maximum rate of L-lactate production by PB2 on cellobiose \( 2 8 g l \( -1 \) h \( -1 \) \) was similar to that on glucose \( 3 0 g l \( -1 \) h \( -1 \) \) This indicates that efficient

complex than grain to ethanol processes This complexity results in part from the complexity of the substrate and the biological limitations of the catalyst Our work at the University of Florida has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of Enteric bacteria using genes encoding Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase These two genes have been assembled into a portable ethanol production cassette , the PET operon , and integrated into the chromosome of Escherichia coli B for use with hemicellulose-derived syrups The resulting strain , KO11 , produces ethanol efficiently from all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose By using the same approach , we integrated the PET operon into the chromosome of Klebsiella oxytoca to produce strain P2 for use in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation \( SSF \) process for cellulose Strain P2 has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose , eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes Recently , the ability to produce and secrete high levels of endoglucanase has also been added to strain P2 , further reducing the requirement for fungal cellulase The general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts using the PET operon has been most successful with Enteric bacteria but was also extended to Gram positive bacteria , which have other useful traits for lignocellulose conversion Many opportunities remain for further improvements in these biocatalysts as we proceed toward the development of single organisms that can

"23956415 20130820 J Exp Bot D016428 D013485 Characterization of rhizosphere fungi that mediate resistance in tomato against bacterial wilt disease Plant immunization for resistance against a wide variety of phytopathogens is an effective strategy for plant disease management Seventy-nine plant growth-promoting fungi \( PGPFs \) were isolated from rhizosphere soil of India Among them , nine revealed saprophytic ability , root colonization , phosphate solubilization , IAA production , and plant growth promotion Seed priming with four PGPFs exhibited early seedling emergence and enhanced vigour of a tomato cultivar susceptible to the bacterial wilt pathogen compared to untreated controls Under greenhouse conditions , TriH JSB27 and PenC JSB41 treatments remarkably enhanced the vegetative and reproductive growth parameters Maximum NPK uptake was noticed in TriH JSB27-treated plants A significant disease reduction of 57 3 against Ralstonia solanacearum was observed in tomato plants pretreated with TriH JSB27 Furthermore , induction of defence-related enzymes and genes was observed in plants pretreated with PGPFs or inoculated with pathogen The maximum phenylalanine ammonia lyase \( PAL \) activity \( 111U \) was observed at 24h in seedlings treated with TriH JSB27 and this activity was slightly reduced \( 99U \) after pathogen inoculation Activities of peroxidase \( POX , 54U \) and -1 , 3-glucanase \( GLU , 15U \) were significantly higher in control plants inoculated with pathogen after 24h and remained constant at all time points A similar trend

disease Plant immunization for resistance against a wide variety of phytopathogens is an effective strategy for plant disease management Seventy-nine plant growth-promoting fungi \( PGPFs \) were isolated from rhizosphere soil of India Among them , nine revealed saprophytic ability , root colonization , phosphate solubilization , IAA production , and plant growth promotion Seed priming with four PGPFs exhibited early seedling emergence and enhanced vigour of a tomato cultivar susceptible to the bacterial wilt pathogen compared to untreated controls Under greenhouse conditions , TriH JSB27 and PenC JSB41 treatments remarkably enhanced the vegetative and reproductive growth parameters Maximum NPK uptake was noticed in TriH JSB27-treated plants A significant disease reduction of 57 3 against Ralstonia solanacearum was observed in tomato plants pretreated with TriH JSB27 Furthermore , induction of defence-related enzymes and genes was observed in plants pretreated with PGPFs or inoculated with pathogen The maximum phenylalanine ammonia lyase \( PAL \) activity \( 111U \) was observed at 24h in seedlings treated with TriH JSB27 and this activity was slightly reduced \( 99U \) after pathogen inoculation Activities of peroxidase \( POX , 54U \) and -1 , 3-glucanase \( GLU , 15U \) were significantly higher in control plants inoculated with pathogen after 24h and remained constant at all time points A similar trend in gene induction for PAL was evident in PGPFs-treated tomato seedlings with or without pathogen inoculation , whereas POX and GLU were upregulated in control plus pathogen-inoculated tomato seedlings These results determine that the susceptible tomato cultivar is triggered after perception of potent PGPFs to synthesize PAL , POX , and GLU , which

formate lyase and ADH were responsible for the remainder Due to the absence of PDH activity in B coagulans during fermentative growth at pH 5 0 , the l-ldh mutant failed to grow anaerobically at pH 5 0 Strain Suy27-13 , a derivative of the l-ldh mutant strain Suy27 , that produced PDH activity during anaerobic growth at pH 5 0 grew at this pH and also produced ethanol as the fermentation product \( 0 39 g per g glucose \) These results show that construction of an ethanologenic B coagulans requires optimal expression of PDH activity in addition to the removal of the LDH activity to support growth and ethanol production",G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C4049864|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205463|G0000000|C0015852|C0871161|G0000000|C0004587|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0596988|C0332268|C0015852|C0022924|C0030016|C0205177|C0004587|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0687682|C3844603|C0001128|C0004611|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C3844603|C0001128|G0000000|G0000000|C0205225|C0015852|C1514468|G0000000|G0000000|C0019494|G0000000|C0030894|G0000000|C1265611|G0000000|C0016832|C1260229|C1514873|G0000000|C0205420|G0000000|G0000000|C0015852|G0000000|C1418773|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0684224|C0040363|G0000000|C0205449|C0040363|C0205450|C0040223|C0441994|G0000000|G0000000|C1418773|G0000000|G0000000|C2698651|C0018270|C0005903|G0000000|C0036024|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1517001|C0040363|C0441994|G0000000|C0007641|C1708715|G0000000|C0033268|C0010186|G0000000|G0000000|C0001962|C0678226|C0040363|C1418773|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205435|C1261552|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0599840|G0000000|G0000000|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|C0205225|C0015852|C0014442|C1881354|C0030016|G0000000|C0849355|G0000000|C0026882|G0000000|C0080194|G0000000|G0000000|C0080194|G0000000|G0000000|C0001962|G0000000|G0000000|C0205225|C0015852|C1514468|G0000000|C0017725|G0000000|C0018270|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0439267|C0001962|G0000000|C0439267|C0017725|G0000000|G0000000|C0034354|C0030016|G0000000|C0034345|G0000000|G0000000|C0001962|C0030016|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205549|C1880177|C0040363|G0000000|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0001962|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0596988|G0000000|C0034354|C0016572|C0024188|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1273518|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0678226|C0040363|G0000000|C0332197|G0000000|C0034345|C0205177|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0015852|C0018270|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439394|C0596988|C0231175|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|C0080194|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C1527240|G0000000|G0000000|C0439394|C0596988|C0080194|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0034345|C0205177|G0000000|C3641081|C0018270|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0450407|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0001962|G0000000|G0000000|C0015852|C1514468|G0000000|G0000000|C0450371|C0439267|G0000000|C0439267|C0017725|G0000000|G0000000|C1274040|C1547282|G0000000|C0441513|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C2698651|C0185117|G0000000|C0034345|C0205177|G0000000|C0332287|C0040363|G0000000|C0015252|G0000000|G0000000|C0022917|C0205177|C0040363|C0183683|C0018270|G0000000|C0001962|C0033268

released is directly related to the amount of non-esterified galacturonic acid units located between two other non-esterified galacturonic acids units on the HG chain The amount released for exo-PG digestion only corresponds to the BS located at the non-reducing end of the polymer The difference between total- and exo-BS was calculated to be the amount of endo-BS located either within or on the reducing end of the HG Three series of model pectins obtained by de-esterification of a high-ester pectin with either plant pectin methyl-esterase \( p-PME , P-series \) , fungal pectin methyl-esterase \( f-PME , F-series \) and chemical de-esterification using base \( B-series \) were analysed and compared with a fully de-esterified pectic acid sample obtained from the same raw material Clear differences for the increase of the amounts of blocksequence could be seen between de-esterification of the P- and F-series samples supporting a blockwise and a homogenous

expressed under each promoter correlated entirely with each mRNA amount , suggesting that GUS production was controlled at the transcriptional level The uidA transcript levels were much lower than the native gene mRNAs , but they were produced in proportion to the mRNA of native cellulase and xylanase genes driven by the same promoters except for the cbh2 promoter Cellulose-degrading activity and protein amount was reduced in cbh1 and cbh2 disruptant mutants compared to the wild-type T reesei PC-3-7 and other uidA transformants The cbh1 disruptant strain was observed to produce more CBH II , EG I , EG III , and xylanases than native PC-3-7 and the other uidA transformants with the same amounts of protein in SDS-PAGE gels This observation was further analyzed by measuring mRNA levels of cellulase and xylanase genes in the disruptants using quantitative real-time PCR In the Pcbh1-gus , mRNA levels for cbh2 and egl1 genes were higher than those in native T reesei PC-3-7 and all other

"23638383 20130503 PeerJ D016428 Cloning , expression and characterization of an ethanol tolerant GH3 -glucosidase from Myceliophthora thermophila The -glucosidase gene bgl3a from Myceliophthora thermophila , member of the fungal glycosyl hydrolase \( GH \) family 3 , was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris The mature -glucosidase gene , which results after the excision of one intron and the secreting signal peptide , was placed under the control of the strong alcohol oxidase promoter \( AOX1 \) in the plasmid pPICZ C The recombinant enzyme \( 90 kDa \) was purified and characterized in order to evaluate its biotechnological potential Recombinant P pastoris efficiently secreted -glucosidase into the medium and produced high level of enzymatic activity \( 41 U ml \) after 192 h of growth , under methanol induction MtBgl3a was able to hydrolyze low molecular weight substrates and polysaccharides containing -glucosidic residues The K m was found to be 0 39 mM on p- -NPG and 2 64 mM on cellobiose Optimal pH and temperature for the p- -NPG hydrolysis were 5 0 and 70 C The -glucosidase exhibits a half life of 143 min at 60 C Kinetic parameters of inhibition were determined for D-glucose , D-xylose and D-gluconic acid , indicating tolerance of the enzyme for these sugars and oxidized products The recombinant enzyme was stimulated by short chain alcohols and has been shown to efficiently synthesize methyl-D-glucoside in the presence of methanol due to its transglycosylation activity The stability of MtBgl3a in ethanol was prominent , and it retained most of its original activity after we exposed it to 50 ethanol for 6 h The high catalytic performance , good thermal stability and tolerance to elevated concentrations of ethanol , D-xylose and D-glucose qualify this

characterization of an ethanol tolerant GH3 -glucosidase from Myceliophthora thermophila The -glucosidase gene bgl3a from Myceliophthora thermophila , member of the fungal glycosyl hydrolase \( GH \) family 3 , was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris The mature -glucosidase gene , which results after the excision of one intron and the secreting signal peptide , was placed under the control of the strong alcohol oxidase promoter \( AOX1 \) in the plasmid pPICZ C The recombinant enzyme \( 90 kDa \) was purified and characterized in order to evaluate its biotechnological potential Recombinant P pastoris efficiently secreted -glucosidase into the medium and produced high level of enzymatic activity \( 41 U ml \) after 192 h of growth , under methanol induction MtBgl3a was able to hydrolyze low molecular weight substrates and polysaccharides containing -glucosidic residues The K m was found to be 0 39 mM on p- -NPG and 2 64 mM on cellobiose Optimal pH and temperature for the p- -NPG hydrolysis were 5 0 and 70 C The -glucosidase exhibits a half life of 143 min at 60 C Kinetic parameters of inhibition were determined for D-glucose , D-xylose and D-gluconic acid , indicating tolerance of the enzyme for these sugars and oxidized products The recombinant enzyme was stimulated by short chain alcohols and has been shown to efficiently synthesize methyl-D-glucoside in the presence of methanol due to its transglycosylation activity The stability of MtBgl3a in ethanol was prominent , and it retained most of its original activity after we exposed it to 50 ethanol for 6 h

Secretion of the related avicelase I \( Mr 61 , 000 \) followed later The carboxymethyl cellulose I was secreted in two molecular weight forms , Mr 44 , 000 and 41 , 000 The evidence is consistent with the idea that three genes account for the secreted glucanase activities Other species result from different glycosylation or proteolytic cleavage processing , which may occur during or after secretion The beta-glucosidase secretion appears to be regulated differently than that of avicelase II or carboxymethyl cellulase I the latter two were regulated coordinately under the conditions used in this work No common immune determinants between the three antigens were

the catalytic mechanism of chitobiase and related chitinolytic enzymes The endoglucanase I complex with the thiosaccharide substrate analogue clearly illustrates the potential of nonhydrolyzable sulfur-linked oligosaccharides in the elucidation of substrate binding and catalysis by glycosyl

gene duplication and loss , as their biological roles include growth and development as well as more stress-responsive functions We used genome sequence data to analyze the size of the chitinase gene

complex , and further suggest that the level of Met-tRNAi \( Met \) is critical for maintaining wild-type rates of initiation in

in this section is that most single mutations in subtilisin BPN'n do not cause major structural alterations Even multiple mutations , though they may cause local minor perturbations at each of the altered sites , do not affect the overall structure to a large degree Bott and Ultsch \( 1986 \) observed that the subtilisin BPN' structure is very tolerant of single mutations , and this tolerance may have been necessary for survival of the enzyme during the course of evolution This structural tolerance is not all that surprising if one considers that the structure of subtilisin Carlsberg is very similar to that of subtilisin BPN' while the protein sequences differ by 31 A superposition of the 274 alpha-carbon atoms of the two enzymes gives a root mean square \( rms \) deviation of 0 053 nm , a value indicating significant structural similarity \( McPhalen and James 1988 \) Furthermore , the fungal enzyme proteinase K , which is classified as part of the subtilisin family , has approximately 38-40 sequence homology with bacilli subtilisins , particularly in the catalytic site and substrate-binding regions \( Betzel et al 1988 \) For these sequence-homology regions there is also a structural similarity indicated by a least squares superposition of alpha-carbons giving an rms deviation of 0 11 nm \( Betzel et al 1988 \) Thermitase , also a member of the subtilisin family , has 47 sequence homology to subtilisin BPN' \( Gros et al 1989 \) If the best 203 alpha-carbon atoms are superposed , then an rms deviation of 0 05 nm is obtained \( Gros et al 1989 \) Apparently a significant amount of sequence variation still allows for overall structural similarities in the subtilisin family of enzymes Though the overall structure of subtilisin is not easily perturbed by single or even multiple mutations , it is clear from the evidence reviewed here that single mutations can lead to very significant effects on the catalytic efficiency , substrate preference , and stability of the enzyme Analyzing the structural alterations in subtilisin mutants will lead to an understanding of the molecular effects of the mutations at the atomic level This understanding enables investigators to model and predict the effects of other substitutions , and allows them to focus their efforts on those mutants that are most likely to have the desired properties \( ABSTRACT

sequence-homology regions there is also a structural similarity indicated by a least squares superposition of alpha-carbons giving an rms deviation of 0 11 nm \( Betzel et al 1988 \) Thermitase , also a member of the subtilisin family , has 47 sequence homology to subtilisin BPN' \( Gros et al 1989 \) If the best 203 alpha-carbon atoms are superposed , then an rms deviation of 0 05 nm is obtained \( Gros et al 1989 \) Apparently a significant amount of sequence variation still allows for overall structural similarities in the subtilisin family of enzymes Though the overall structure of subtilisin is not easily perturbed by single or even multiple mutations , it is clear from the evidence reviewed here that single mutations can lead to very significant effects on the catalytic efficiency , substrate preference , and stability of the enzyme Analyzing the structural alterations in subtilisin mutants will lead to an understanding of the molecular effects of the mutations at the atomic level This understanding enables investigators to model and predict the effects of other substitutions , and allows them to focus their efforts on those mutants that are most likely to have the desired properties \( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS

"20393703 20100416 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol D023362 D016428 D013485 Development of a highly efficient gene targeting system allowing rapid genetic manipulations in Penicillium decumbens Penicillium decumbens is an important industrial filamentous fungus and has been widely used in biorefinery due to its high production of cellulase and hemicellulase However , molecular engineering has still rarely been applied for strain improvement in P decumbens It has been proven that gene targeting manipulation in many filamentous fungi is hampered by nonhomologous end-joining \( NHEJ \) pathway To improve gene targeting efficiency in P decumbens , the putative pku70 encoding the Ku70 homologue involved in the NHEJ pathway was identified and deleted The Deltapku70 strain showed no apparent

Penicillium decumbens is an important industrial filamentous fungus and has been widely used in biorefinery due to its high production of cellulase and hemicellulase However , molecular engineering has still rarely been applied for strain improvement in P decumbens It has been proven that gene targeting manipulation in many filamentous fungi is hampered by nonhomologous end-joining \( NHEJ \) pathway To improve gene targeting efficiency in P decumbens , the putative pku70 encoding the Ku70 homologue involved in the NHEJ pathway was identified and deleted The Deltapku70 strain showed no apparent defect in vegetative growth , conidiation , and cellulase production , and displayed similar sensitivity to chemical agents of hygromycin B , ethyl methane sulfonate , and H2O2 at different concentrations compared with the wild-type strain The effect of the absence of pku70 on gene targeting was tested by disruption of creA encoding a putative carbon catabolite repressor and xlnR

characterised amplified region \( SCAR \) marker the assays were compared to a published method based on SYBR Green I technology The assays designed to the IGS region and SCAR marker proved to be highly specific for B cinerea but assays designed to the beta-tubulin gene and the previously published assay designed to the cutinase-A gene both cross-react with B fabae The assay designed to the IGS region was the most sensitive and was able to reliably detect and quantify as little as 20 fg of B cinerea DNA The method incorporates the detection of a gene from the plant host to compensate for variations in extraction efficiency and size of sample tested The assays designed were used to follow the progression of infection of B cinerea in plant material inoculated with spores to the point of symptom induction They should be ideally suited to investigating infection processes in-planta and could be used to investigate aspects of infection plant pathogenesis , by B cinerea and are particularly suited to the detection and quantification of the pathogen prior to the development of symptoms",G0000000|G0000000|C0032098|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0243107|G0000000|C1550177|C0032520|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0005507|G0000000|G0000000|C1511790|G0000000|C1709793|G0000000|C0006040|G0000000|G0000000|C0230463|C1550177|C0032520|C0005507|C1527178|G0000000|G0000000|C0007996|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1511790|G0000000|C1709793|G0000000|C0006040|G0000000|G0000000|C3900053|G0000000|G0000000|C0332464|C1514721|G0000000|C1705242|C1167395|C0032098|C1705920|C0005507|G0000000|C1707689|C0040363|G0000000|C0005290|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0221874|G0000000|C1306856|G0000000|C0017446|G0000000|G0000000|C0521447|C0035553|C0012854|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|C0034037|G0000000|C0037783|C0004793|G0000000|G0000000|C0017446|G0000000|C0241158|G0000000|C0005516|G0000000|C0005507|G0000000|C1707455|C0040363|G0000000|C0034037|C0025663|C1527178|G0000000|G0000000|C0332583|C0021966|C0039421|G0000000|C0005507|C1707689|C0040363|G0000000|C1306856|C0017446|G0000000|C0241158|C0005516|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C0205250|C0205369|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0005507|C1707689|C0040363|G0000000|C0005290|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0034037|C0005507|C1707689|C0040363|G0000000|C0056619|C0017337|G0000000|C2828360|G0000000|G0000000|C1150936|G0000000|C0005507|C1707689|C0040363|G0000000|C1306856|C0017446|G0000000|G0000000|C0205393|C0020517|G0000000|G0000000|C0085732|C0040363|G0000000|C0442726|G0000000|C1709793|G0000000|C0700321|G0000000|C0450371|C0016703|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0012854|G0000000|C0025663|G0000000|G0000000|C1511790|G0000000|G0000000|C0017337|G0000000|G0000000|C0032098|C1167395|C0040363|C0205432|G0000000|C0205419|G0000000|C0185115|C0013682|G0000000|C0456389|G0000000|C0370003|C0392366|G0000000|C0005507|C1707689|G0000000|C1273517|C0040363|C0332283|G0000000|C0242656|G0000000|C0009450|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0032098|C0520510|C2987620|G0000000|C0038027|C0040363|G0000000|C1552961|G0000000|C1457887|C0205263|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|C1292732|C0009450|C1184743|C0230463|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1273517|C0040363|C1292732|C1547011|G0000000|C0009450|C0032098|C0543483|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0040363|G0000000|C1511790|G0000000|C1709793|G0000000|G0000000|C0450254|C0332152|C0040363|G0000000|C0243107|G0000000|C0683368

protein metabolism , milk yield , feed conversion ratio \( FCR \) and body condition score of high-yielding dairy cows A lignolytic enzyme preparation produced by the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus was applied in the present experiment and fed to dairy cows at 34 g day dosage in the period between calving and the 110th day of lactation This preparation increased VFA concentration in the rumen from about 32 days after calving and onward Increased VFA concentration was followed by an about 5 to 10 increase in milk production and an almost 0 1 increase in butterfat production Increased VFA concentration produced more balanced energy metabolism in the experimental cows as indicated by the lower incidence rate of hyperketonaemia , and lower acetoacetic acid and non-esterified fatty acid \( NEFA \) concentration in the blood of the experimental cows Aspartate aminotransferase \( AST \) activity was tendentiously higher in the control group and the proportion
