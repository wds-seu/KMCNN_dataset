for predicting postoperative survival and assessing the impact of variation on clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma \( HCC \) MATERIAL AND METHODS A genome-wide association study of 367 patients with HCC was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms \( SNPs \) associated with prognosis Identified predictors were further evaluated in 758 patients Two prognostic models were established using Cox proportional hazards regression and Nomogram strategy , and validated in another 316 patients The effect of the SNP rs2431 was analyzed in detail RESULTS A prognostic model including 5 SNPs \( rs10893585 , rs2431 , rs34675408 , rs6078460 , and rs6766361 \) was established and exhibited high predictive accuracy for HCC prognosis The panel combined with tumor node metastasis \( TNM \) stage resulted in a significantly higher c-index \( 0 723 \) than the individual c-index values Stratified by the Nomogram prediction model , the median overall survival for the low-risk and high-risk groups were 100 1 versus 30 8 months \( P 0 001 \) in the training set and 82 2 versus 22 5 months \( P 0 001 \) in the validation set A closer examination of

the SNPs was co-inherited with APOE allele 4 , which is the most important genetic risk factor for AD Three of the five SNPs were located in promoter or enhancer regions , and transcription factor \( TF \) binding affinity calculations showed dramatic changes \( Log2FC 2 \) of three TFs \( PLAG1 , RREB1 , and ZBTB33 \) for two motifs containing SNPs rs2075650 and rs157580 In addition , our GWAS showed that both rs2075650 and rs157580 were significantly associated with the poliovirus receptor-related 2 \( PVRL2 \) gene \( FDR 0 25 \) , which is involved in spreading of herpes simplex virus \( HSV \) The altered regulation of PVRL2 may increase the susceptibility AD patients to HSV and other virus infections of the brain Our work suggests that AD is a type of immune disorder driven by viral or microbial infections of the brain during aging Front Genet

"30412241 20181110 Genome-wide association study of cervical cancer suggests a role for ARRDC3 gene in human papillomavirus infection The development of cervical cancer is initiated by human papillomavirus \( HPV \) infection and involves both viral and host genetic factors Genome-wide association studies \( GWAS \) of cervical cancer have identified associations in the HLA locus and two loci outside HLA , but the principal genes that control infection and pathogenesis have not been identified In the present study , we performed GWAS of cervical cancer in East Asian populations , involving 2609 cases and 4712 controls in the discovery stage and 1461 cases and 3295 controls in the follow-up stage We identified novel-significant associations at 5q14 with the lead single

cervical cancer suggests a role for ARRDC3 gene in human papillomavirus infection The development of cervical cancer is initiated by human papillomavirus \( HPV \) infection and involves both viral and host genetic factors Genome-wide association studies \( GWAS \) of cervical cancer have identified associations in the HLA locus and two loci outside HLA , but the principal genes that control infection and pathogenesis have not been identified In the present study , we performed GWAS of cervical cancer in East Asian populations , involving 2609 cases and 4712 controls in the discovery stage and 1461 cases and 3295 controls in the follow-up stage We identified novel-significant associations at 5q14 with the lead single nucleotide polymorphism \( SNP \) rs59661306 \( P 2 4 10-11 \)

STAT1 , FCGR2C , NIPSNAP3B , and SCT \) significantly associated and 4 genes \( SERBP1 , PINX1 , TMEM175 and EXOC2 \) suggestively associated with SSc in the gene level analysis in White patients As an exploratory analysis we compared the results on Whites with those from African Americans Of previously established susceptibility genes identified in Whites , only TNFAIP3 was significant at the nominal level \( p 6 13x10-3 \) in African Americans in the gene-level analysis of the ImmunoChip data Among the top suggestive novel genes identified in Whites based on the ImmunoChip data , FCGR2C and PINX1 were only nominally significant in African Americans \( p 0 016 and p 0 028 , respectively \) , while among the top novel genes identified in the gene-level analysis in African Americans , UNC5C \( p 5 57x10-4 \) and CLEC16A \( p 0 0463 \) were also nominally significant in Whites We also present the gene-level analysis of SSc clinical and autoantibody phenotypes among Whites Our findings need to be validated by independent studies , particularly due to the limited sample size of African Americans PLoS ONE D003160 D016428 D052061

"30265060 20180929 Genetic influences on delayed reward discounting A genome-wide prioritized subset approach Delayed reward discounting \( DRD \) is a behavioral economic measure of impulsivity that has been consistently associated with addiction It has also been identified as a promising addiction endophenotype , linking specific sources of genetic variation to individual risk A challenge in the studies to date is that levels of DRD are often confounded with prior drug use , and previous studies have also had limited genomic scope The current investigation sought to address these issues by studying DRD in healthy young adults with low levels of substance use \( N 986 62 female , 100 European ancestry \) and investigating genetic variation genome-wide The genome-wide approach used a prioritized subset design , organizing the tests into theoretically and empirically informed categories and apportioning power accordingly Three subsets were used \( a \) a priori loci implicated by previous studies \( b \) high-value addiction \( HVA \) markers from the recently developed SmokeScreen array and \( c \) an atheoretical genome-wide scan Among a priori loci , a nominally significant

Genome-wide association studies of birth weight have focused on fetal genetics , whereas relatively little is known about the role of maternal genetic variation We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight that could highlight potentially relevant maternal determinants of fetal growth We meta-analysed data on up to 8 7 million SNPs in up to 86 577 women of European

predisposition to both disorders compared to controls We identify five genomic regions with evidence of colocalising SCZ and T2D signals , three of which contain known loci for both diseases We also observe a significant excess of shared association signals between SCZ and T2D at nine out of ten investigated p value thresholds Finally , we identify 29 genes associated with both T2D and SCZ ,

environmental , inflammatory , infectious , and genetic risk factors have been proposed We performed a genome-wide association study \( GWAS \) in a European-American cohort of 343 isolated BA patients and 1716 controls to identify genetic loci associated with BA A second GWAS was performed in an independent European-American cohort of 156 patients with BA and other extrahepatic anomalies and 212 controls to confirm the identified candidate BA-associated SNPs Meta-analysis revealed three genome-wide significant BA-associated SNPs on 2p16 1 \( rs10865291 , rs6761893 , and rs727878 P 5

expression analysis showed an increase in EFEMP1 transcripts from human liver specimens isolated from patients with either BA or other cholestatic diseases when compared to normal control liver
