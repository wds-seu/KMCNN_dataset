autoantibodies and evaluated the genotype-phenotype relationship in 10 Japanese patients with aHUS We identified 7 causative or potentially causative mutations in CFH \( p R1215Q \) , C3 \( p R425C ,

The patients carrying mutations in CFH or C3 had a high frequency of relapse and a worse prognosis One patient had CFH autoantibodies The present study identified the cause of aHUS in 9 out of 10

"25510197 20141217 Dopamine and cognitive control sex-by-genotype interactions influence the capacity to switch attention Cognitive performance in healthy persons varies widely between individuals Sex differences in cognition are well reported , and there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that the relationship between dopaminergic neurotransmission , implicated in many cognitive functions , is modulated by sex Here , we examine the influence of sex and genetic variations along the dopaminergic pathway on aspects of cognitive control A total of 415 healthy individuals , selected from an international consortium linked to Brain Research and Integrative Neuroscience Network \( BRAINnet \) , were genotyped for two common and functional genetic variations of dopamine regulating genes the catechol-O-methyltransferase COMT gene \( rs4680 \) and the dopamine receptor D2 DRD2 gene \( rs6277 \) Cognitive measures were selected to explore sustained attention \( using a continuous performance task \) , switching of attention \( using a Trails B adaptation \) and working memory \( a visual computerised adaptation of digit span \) While there were no main effects for genotype across any tasks , analyses revealed significant sex by genotype interactions for the capacity to switch attention In relation to COMT , superior performance was noted in females with the Val Val genotype and for DRD2 , superior performance was seen for TT females and CC males These findings highlight the importance of considering genetic variation in baseline dopamine levels in addition to sex , when considering the impact of dopamine on cognition in healthy populations These findings also have important implications for the many neuropsychiatric disorders that implicate dopamine ,

severe pneumonitis , aplastic anaemia , gastritis and cerebral vasculitis A diagnosis of XLP was made , based on flow cytometric analysis and the identification of a novel mutation in SH2D1A , c 96G gt C No peripheral blood lymphocyte clonal proliferation was identified and he was EBV negative , although human herpes virus-7 \( HHV7 \) was detected repeatedly in his cerebrospinal fluid He underwent a reduced intensity unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant , but failed to engraft A second 5 6 matched cord gave 100 donor engraftment Complications included BK virus-associated haemorrhagic cystitis , a possible NK-cell mediated immune reconstitution syndrome and post-transplant anti-glomerular basement membrane disease , the latter treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab At 450 days post-transplant he is in remission from his vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease , and HHV-7 has remained undetectable This is the second published description of joint disease in XLP , and only the fourth case of non-EBV associated cerebral vasculitis in XLP , as well as being the first to be successfully treated for this manifestation This case raises specific questions about vasculitis in XLP , in particular the potential relevance of HHV-7 to the pathogenesis J Clin Immunol D002363

involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation mediated by p53 Indeed , forced expression of RUNX2 resulted in a remarkable downregulation of p53-target genes Consistent with these observations , knockdown of RUNX2 enhanced ADR-mediated apoptosis and also elevated p53-target gene expression in response to ADR On the other hand , depletion of RUNX2 in p53-deficient human lung

"8993332 19970107 Selective inhibition of the prothrombinase complex factor Va alters macromolecular recognition of a tick anticoagulant peptide mutant by factor Xa The prothrombinase complex assembles through reversible interactions between the protease , factor Xa , the cofactor , factor Va , and acidic phospholipid membranes in the presence of calcium ions Changes in macromolecular recognition by factor Xa which may result from its interaction with factor Va in the prothrombinase complex have been probed using a recombinant derivative of tick anticoagulant peptide where Arg3 has been replaced with Ala \( R3A-TAP \) In contrast to the wild type inhibitor , R3A-TAP was a weak competitive inhibitor of factor Xa \( Ki 794 nM \) The inhibition of the prothrombinase complex by R3A-TAP was characterized by slow , tight-binding kinetics with an increased affinity of approximately 4000-fold \( Ki 0 195 nM \) relative to that of solution-phase factor Xa Stopped-flow measurements using p-aminobenzamidine \( PAB \) demonstrated that the reaction between solution-phase factor Xa and R3A-TAP could be adequately described by a single reversible step with rate constants that were consistent with equilibrium binding measurements The rate-limiting bimolecular combination of R3A-TAP and factor Xa was competitive with PAB binding of the protease In contrast , the reaction of R3A-TAP with prothrombinase measured using PAB yielded biphasic stopped-flow traces , indicating a multistep pathway for the reaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme complex The kinetic measurements were consistent with the initial formation of a ternary complex between R3A-TAP , prothrombinase , and PAB followed by two unimolecular steps which lead to PAB dissociation from the enzyme In this case , prior occupation of the active site by PAB had no effect on the bimolecular reaction between R3A-TAP and prothrombinase Thus , the interaction of factor Xa with factor Va on the membrane surface alters recognition of R3A-TAP by the protease , leading to changes in the thermodynamics as well as in the observed kinetic mechanism for the reaction Therefore , a single amino acid substitution in TAP reveals large changes in macromolecular recognition by factor Xa as a consequence of its interaction with the cofactor within the prothrombinase complex Biochemistry D016428

"11307814 20010420 Genetic predisposition to bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy evidence for common founder mutations \( FIXVal-10 and FIXThr-10 \) and an independent CpG hotspot mutation \( FIXThr-10 \) The recent discovery of five patients with coumarin sensitive FIX-variants due to a missense mutation in the FIX propeptide , either Ala-10Val or Ala-10Thr , has highlighted a novel type of genetic predisposition to bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy \( OAT \) In the present study , we report six additional patients with such FIX variants Haplotype analysis of FIX polymorphisms revealed a founder effect in the five German and Swiss patients with the Val-10 variant Also , four Thr-10 variants detected in Germany , Switzerland and Great Britain derived from a common founder Two Thr-10 variants from USA showed an independent de novo origin at a CpG dinucleotide that in general represents a mutation hotspot These findings implicate the existence of additional subjects with corresponding variants in the populations of various countries Even though the rare occurrence of these variants does not justify a general aPTT screening during OAT , it is

evidence for common founder mutations \( FIXVal-10 and FIXThr-10 \) and an independent CpG hotspot mutation \( FIXThr-10 \) The recent discovery of five patients with coumarin sensitive FIX-variants due to a missense mutation in the FIX propeptide , either Ala-10Val or Ala-10Thr , has highlighted a novel type of genetic predisposition to bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy \( OAT \) In the present study , we report six additional patients with such FIX variants Haplotype analysis of FIX polymorphisms revealed a founder effect in the five German and Swiss patients with the Val-10 variant Also , four Thr-10 variants detected in Germany , Switzerland and Great Britain derived from a common founder Two Thr-10 variants from USA showed an independent de novo origin at a CpG dinucleotide that in general represents a mutation hotspot These findings implicate the existence of additional subjects with corresponding variants in the populations of various countries Even though the rare occurrence of these variants does not justify a general aPTT screening during OAT , it is recommended to monitor each bleeding event during OAT in males in order to exclude a genetic predisposition to bleeding by means of the following testing strategy a \) aPTT-testing in each bleeding complication of male patients during OAT , b \) if aPTT is disproportionately prolonged , determination of FIX C

"11796727 20020118 Essential hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal regions including cysteine residues of the yeast stretch-activated calcium-permeable channel Mid1 The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae MID1 gene encodes a stretch-activated Ca \( 2 \) -permeable nonselective cation channel composed of 548 amino acid residues A physiological role of the Mid1 channel is known to maintain the viability of yeast cells exposed to mating pheromone , but its structural basis remains to be clarified To solve this problem , we identified the mutation sites of mid1 mutant alleles generated by in vivo ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and found that two mid1 alleles have nonsense mutations at the codon for Trp \( 441 \) , generating a truncated Mid1 protein lacking two-thirds of the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region from Asn \( 389 \) to Thr \( 548 \) In vitro random mutagenesis with hydroxylamine also showed that the carboxyl-terminal region is essential To identify the functional portion of the carboxyl-terminal region in detail , we performed a progressive carboxyl-terminal truncation followed by functional analyses and found that the truncated protein produced from the mid1 allele bearing the amber mutation at the codon for Phe \( 522 \) \( F522Am \) complemented the mating pheromone-induced death phenotype of the mid1 mutant and increased its Ca \( 2 \) uptake activity to a wild-type level , whereas N521Am did not This result indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain spanning from Asn \( 389 \) to Asn \( 521 \) is required for Mid1 function Interestingly , this domain is cysteine-rich , and alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that seven out of 10 cysteine residues are unexchangeable These results clearly indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain including

and protect retinoids during the visual cycle X-ray crystallographic studies had noted a betabetaalpha-spiral fold shared with crotonases and C-terminal protein transferases The shallow cleft formed by the fold was assumed to represent the retinol-binding site However , a second hydrophobic site consisting of a highly restricted cavity was more recently appreciated during in silico ligand-docking studies In this study , the ligand-binding environment within the second module of Xenopus IRBP \( X2IRBP \) is defined Pristine recombinant polypeptide corresponding to X2IRBP was expressed in a soluble form and purified to homogeneity without its fusion tag Phenylalanine was substituted for tryptophan at each of the putative retinol-binding domains \( W450F , hydrophobic cavity W587F , shallow cleft \) Binding of 11-cis and all-trans retinol were observed in titrations monitoring retinol fluorescence enhancement , quenching of tryptophan fluorescence , and energy transfer The effect of oleic acid on retinol binding was also examined A ligand-binding stoichiometry of approximately 1 1 was observed for 11-cis and all-trans with K \( d \) in the tens of nanomolar range The substitution mutants showed little effect on retinol binding in titrations after fluorescence enhancement However , the W450F and not the W587F mutant showed a markedly reduced capacity for fluorescence quenching for both 11-cis and all-trans retinol Oleic acid inhibited the binding of 11-cis and all-trans retinol in an apparent noncompetitive manner The binding site for 11-cis and

target and protect retinoids during the visual cycle X-ray crystallographic studies had noted a betabetaalpha-spiral fold shared with crotonases and C-terminal protein transferases The shallow cleft formed by the fold was assumed to represent the retinol-binding site However , a second hydrophobic site consisting of a highly restricted cavity was more recently appreciated during in silico ligand-docking studies In this study , the ligand-binding environment within the second module of Xenopus IRBP \( X2IRBP \) is defined Pristine recombinant polypeptide corresponding to X2IRBP was expressed in a soluble form and purified to homogeneity without its fusion tag Phenylalanine was substituted for tryptophan at each of the putative retinol-binding domains \( W450F , hydrophobic cavity W587F , shallow cleft \) Binding of 11-cis and all-trans retinol were observed in titrations monitoring retinol fluorescence enhancement , quenching of tryptophan fluorescence , and energy transfer The effect of oleic acid on retinol binding was also examined A ligand-binding stoichiometry of approximately 1 1 was observed for 11-cis and all-trans with K \( d \) in the tens of nanomolar range The substitution mutants showed little effect on retinol binding in titrations after fluorescence enhancement However , the W450F and not the W587F mutant showed a markedly reduced capacity for fluorescence quenching for both 11-cis and all-trans retinol Oleic acid inhibited the binding of 11-cis and all-trans retinol in an apparent noncompetitive manner The binding site for 11-cis and all-trans retinol is a novel hydrophobic cavity that is highly restrictive and probably distinct from the long chain fatty acid-binding site Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci D016428 D052061 D013485

"3902841 19851125 Replacement by site-directed mutagenesis indicates a role for histidine 170 in the glutamine amide transfer function of anthranilate synthase Anthranilate synthase is a glutamine amidotransferase that catalyzes the first reaction in tryptophan biosynthesis Conserved amino acid residues likely to be essential for glutamine-dependent activity were identified by alignment of the glutamine amide transfer domains in four different enzymes anthranilate synthase component II \( AS II \) , p-aminobenzoate synthase component II , GMP synthetase , and carbamoyl-P synthetase Conserved amino acids were mainly localized in three clusters A single conserved histidine , AS II His-170 , was replaced by tyrosine using site-directed mutagenesis Glutamine-dependent enzyme activity was undetectable in the Tyr-170 mutant , whereas the NH3-dependent activity was unchanged Affinity labeling of AS II active site Cys-84 by 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine was used to distinguish whether His-170 has a role in formation or in breakdown of the covalent glutaminyl-Cys-84 intermediate The data favor the interpretation that His-170 functions as a general base to promote

the glutamine amide transfer function of anthranilate synthase Anthranilate synthase is a glutamine amidotransferase that catalyzes the first reaction in tryptophan biosynthesis Conserved amino acid residues likely to be essential for glutamine-dependent activity were identified by alignment of the glutamine amide transfer domains in four different enzymes anthranilate synthase component II \( AS II \) , p-aminobenzoate synthase component II , GMP synthetase , and carbamoyl-P synthetase Conserved amino acids were mainly localized in three clusters A single conserved histidine , AS II His-170 , was replaced by tyrosine using site-directed mutagenesis Glutamine-dependent enzyme activity was undetectable in the Tyr-170 mutant , whereas the NH3-dependent activity was unchanged Affinity labeling of AS II active site Cys-84 by 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine was used to distinguish whether His-170 has a role in formation or in breakdown of the covalent glutaminyl-Cys-84 intermediate The data favor the interpretation that His-170 functions as a general base to promote glutaminylation of Cys-84 Reversion analysis was consistent with a proposed role of His-170 in catalysis as opposed to a structural

"24136861 20131019 Paralogue annotation identifies novel pathogenic variants in patients with Brugada syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia Distinguishing genetic variants that cause disease from variants that are rare but benign is one of the principal challenges in contemporary clinical genetics , particularly as variants are identified at a pace exceeding the capacity of researchers to characterise them functionally We previously developed a novel method , called paralogue annotation , which accurately and specifically identifies disease-causing missense variants by transferring disease-causing annotations across families of related proteins Here we refine our approach , and apply it to novel variants found in 2266 patients across two large cohorts with inherited sudden death syndromes , namely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia \( CPVT \) or Brugada syndrome \( BrS \) Over one third of the novel non-synonymous variants found in these studies , which would otherwise be reported in a clinical diagnostics setting as 'variants of unknown significance' , are categorised by our method as likely disease causing \( positive predictive value 98 7 \) This identified more than 500 new disease loci for BrS and CPVT Our methodology is widely transferable across all human disease genes , with an estimated 150 000 potentially informative annotations in more than 1800 genes We have developed a web resource that allows researchers and clinicians to annotate variants found in individuals with inherited arrhythmias , comprising a referenced compendium of known missense variants in these genes together with a user-friendly implementation of our approach This tool will facilitate the interpretation of many novel

"11781320 20020110 Differential determinants for peptide and non-peptidyl ligand binding to the motilin receptor Critical role of second extracellular loop for peptide binding and action The predicted second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor is of particular interest because it is a region that is quite distinct from the analogous regions in other family members that are most closely related and because the initial report of the photoaffinity labeling of a domain of this receptor included this region \( Coulie , B J , Matsuura , B , Dong , M , Hadac , E M , Pinon , D I , Feighner , S D , Howard , A D , and Miller , L J \( 2001 \) J Biol Chem 276 , 35518-35522 \) In the current work , motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs DeltaCys \( 235 \) , Delta179-182 , and Delta241-246 Cys \( 235 \) is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop , Val \( 179 \) and Leu \( 245 \) and Arg \( 246 \) ,

second extracellular loop for peptide binding and action The predicted second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor is of particular interest because it is a region that is quite distinct from the analogous regions in other family members that are most closely related and because the initial report of the photoaffinity labeling of a domain of this receptor included this region \(

constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included

nuclear magnetic resonance and high-pressure fluorescence techniques Wild type apoMb is resistant to pressures up to 80 MPa , and denatures to a high-pressure intermediate , I \( p \) , between 80 and 200 MPa A further increase of pressure to 500 MPa results in denaturation of the intermediate The two tryptophans , both in the A helix , remain sequestered from solvent in the high-pressure intermediate , which retains some native NOESY cross peaks in the AGH core as well as between F33 and F43 High-pressure fluorescence shows that the tryptophans remain inaccessible to solvent in the I \( p \) state Thus the high-pressure intermediate has some structural properties in common with the apoMb I \( 2 \) acid intermediate The resistance of the AGH core to pressures up to 200 MPa provides further evidence that the intrinsic stability of these alpha-helices is responsible for their presence in a number of equilibrium intermediates as well as in the earliest kinetic folding intermediate

very low pressures and both denature to the intermediate by 100 MPa , half of the pressure required for wild type apoMb Thus a similar intermediate state is created independent of the method of

elevated fasting triglycerides and glucose \( but in the normal range \) and a higher insulin response in OGTT \( 4 1-fold vs 2 5-fold \) From different insulin measurements HOMA index turned out to

"22340303 20120221 The use of digital photographs for the diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis the AGES-Reykjavik study The objective of the study was to standardize a method using digital photographs to diagnose and grade hand osteoarthritis \( HOA \) , to compare it with radiographs and clinical examination with regard to prevalence and relation to symptoms , and finally to construct a simple shortened version suitable for use in very large studies , where a global estimate may be preferable High quality photographs with standard distance and hand positioning were analysed for the presence of HOA and subsequently compared with standard radiographs and clinical examination in 381 random participants in the AGES-Reykjavik Study , a large population study The mean age of the participants was 76 years Using the photographic method , the most commonly affected joints were the second DIP joints followed by the third DIP joints and second and third PIP joints Both interobserver \( ICC 0

association with hand pain in females The performance of photography in predicting pain on most days for at least a month in females was comparable to that of radiography and clinical examination \( AUC 0 63 p 0 004 \) Analysis of intermittent pain yielded similar results for in the DIP and PIP joints \( OR 3 2-3 3 , p lt 0 01 \) , but for the CMC1 joints , both radiography \( OR 9 0 , p lt 0

photographs also showed a high degree of correlation with the other methods \( R \( s \) 0 56-0 82 \) High quality hand photographs can be used to diagnose and grade hand osteoarthritis The method has the advantage of being inexpensive and easy to perform By using a slightly simplified method of reading , it appears to be highly suitable for use in large studies BMC Musculoskelet Disord D016428

acetylcoenzyme A , including one in which CO enters the enzyme and migrates through the tunnel before binding at the A-cluster , and another in which CO binds the A-cluster directly from the solvent J

the active site of the wild-type enzyme \( 1 55 A \) structure does not contain sulfate and Ser70 appears to be in the deprotonated form The X-ray crystal structure of the S70G mutant has an altered Ser130 side-chain conformation that influences the positions of water molecules in the active site This change allows an additional water molecule to be positioned similarly to the serine hydroxyl in the wild-type enzyme The structure of the mutant enzyme suggests that this water molecule can assume the role of an active-site nucleophile and carry out noncovalent catalysis The drop in activity in

expressed in more invasive PCa cell lines \( PC3 gt C4-2B gt LNCaP \) Furthermore , analysis using a P-S319-Runx2-specific antibody revealed that the ratio of P-S319-Runx2 total Runx2 as well as P-ERK total ERK was highest in PC3 followed by C4-2B and LNCaP cells These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy , which showed a higher percentage of PC3 cells staining positive

"11929530 20020404 The nrfI gene is essential for the attachment of the active site haem group of Wolinella succinogenes cytochrome c nitrite reductase The cytochrome c nitrite reductase complex \( NrfHA \) is the terminal enzyme in the electron transport chain catalysing nitrite respiration of Wolinella succinogenes The catalytic subunit NrfA is a pentahaem cytochrome c containing an active site haem group which is covalently bound via the cysteine residues of a unique CWTCK motif The lysine residue serves as the axial ligand of the haem iron The other four haem groups of NrfA are bound by conventional haem-binding motifs \( CXXCH \) The nrfHAIJ locus was restored on the genome of the W succinogenes DeltanrfAIJ deletion mutant by integration of a plasmid , thus enabling the expression of modified alleles of nrfA and nrfI A mutant \( K134H \) was constructed which contained a nrfA gene encoding a CWTCH motif instead of CWTCK NrfA of strain K134H was found to be synthesized with five bound haem groups , as judged by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization \( MALDI \) mass spectrometry Its nitrite reduction activity with reduced benzyl viologen was 40 of the wild-type activity Ammonia was formed as the only product of nitrite reduction The mutant did not grow by nitrite respiration and its electron transport activity from formate to nitrite was 5 of that of the wild-type strain The predicted nrfI gene product is similar to proteins involved in system II cytochrome c biogenesis A mutant of W succinogenes \( stopI \) was constructed that contained a nrfHAIJ gene cluster with the nrfI codons 47 and 48 altered to stop codons The NrfA protein of this mutant did not catalyse nitrite reduction and lacked the active site haem group , whereas the other four haem groups were present Mutant \( K134H stopI \) which contained the K134H modification in NrfA in addition to the inactivated nrfI gene had essentially the same properties as strain K134H NrfA from strain K134H stopI contained five haem groups It is concluded that NrfI is involved in haem attachment to the CWTCK motif in NrfA but not to any of the CXXCH motifs The nrfI gene is obviously dispensable for maturation of a modified NrfA protein containing a CWTCH motif instead of CWTCK Therefore , NrfI might function as a specific haem lyase that recognizes the active site lysine residue of NrfA A similar role has been proposed for NrfE , F and G of Escherichia coli , although these proteins share no overall sequence similarity to NrfI and belong to system I cytochrome

"9174346 19970527 Recognition of the T stem-loop of a pre-tRNA substrate by the ribozyme from Bacillus subtilis ribonuclease P The ribozyme from bacterial ribonuclease P \( denoted P RNA \) specifically recognizes the coaxially stacked T stem-loop and the acceptor stem of a tRNA substrate This recognition is mediated primarily through tertiary interactions At least four 2'-OH groups in the T stem-loop region have been implicated as direct contacts with Bacillus subtilis P RNA Pan , T , et al \( 1995 \) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 92 , 12510 Effects of six single 2'-OH -- gt 2'-H substitutions and two base mutants of the G19-C56 tertiary interaction in tRNA on substrate binding \( Kd \) and the chemical step of the reaction \( k2 \) have been determined using a tRNA \( Phe \) substrate containing a 2'-deoxy residue at the cleavage site Our results show that at least five functional groups in the T stem-loop of tRNA directly participate in P RNA binding They include the 2'-OH groups of residues 54 , 56 , 61 , and 62 and possibly the 4-amino group of the conserved C56 The 2'-OHs of residues 54 , 61 , and 62 are positioned within the same minor groove due to stacking of the reverse Hoogsteen U54-A58 pair on the G53-C61 Watson-Crick pair in the T stem This groove is extended to the 4-amino group of C56 through the tertiary structure of tRNA We use the term quot tertiary groove quot to describe alignment of functional groups through tertiary folding of an RNA The binding also includes the 2'-OH of nucleotide C56 which is not located in this tertiary groove Assuming additivity , these five interactions can contribute 7 4 kcal mol or 10 \( 5 \) -fold in binding but only -0 5 kcal mol or approximately 2-fold in chemistry at 37 degrees C The P RNA binding site for the T stem-loop includes at least the previously identified A230 as well as the A130 in B subtilis P RNA The Kd and k2 data from the A130G mutant of B subtilis P RNA suggest that A130 may be proximal to residue 56 in tRNA These results show how the highly structured T stem-loop region in a pre-tRNA substrate is bound by the B subtilis P RNA This is among the first examples of how a nonhelical RNA structure can be recognized by another RNA through tertiary interactions Biochemistry D016428 D013485 D013487","9174346 19970527 Recognition of the T stem-loop of a pre-tRNA substrate

in the SPS cases in the PTEN , SMAD4 , and BMPR1A genes A novel variant in intron 2 \( c 164 223T gt C \) of PTEN was identified in one individual and was predicted by in silico analysis to have no functional consequences One further individual with SPS was found to be mono-allelic for the MUTYH G396D mutation No individuals carried the recently reported duplication within GREM1 Genes involved

C Both mdVp1 formation and most of the multiprotein complex formation were blocked by a Vp1 folding mutation , C87A-C254A Our observations are consistent with a role for LT in facilitating the folding process of SV40 Vp1 by stimulating certain covalent modifications of Vp1 or by recruiting certain cellular proteins J Virol D016428 D052061 D013485",G0000000|G0000000|C0220781|G0000000|G0000000|C0392747|C0185026|C0205103|G0000000|G0000000|C0042776|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|C0549177|C2603360|C0003320|C0007634|G0000000|C0185026|G0000000|G0000000|C1706853|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0042776|C0450371|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205082|C0006933|C0033684|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1515187|C0442504|G0000000|G0000000|C0439663|C0010834|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1547282|C0040363|C1272688|G0000000|C0012771|G0000000|C0185026|C0205103|G0000000|G0000000|C0684224|G0000000|G0000000|C1517331|G0000000|G0000000|C0015276|G0000000|G0000000|C0683312|G0000000|G0000000|C0185026|G0000000|C1706853|C0205103|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0392747|G0000000|G0000000|C1705920|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|C0454802|C0007634|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1514798|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0032136|C0040669|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007634|G0000000|C1881488|C0039798|G0000000|C0600209|C0012634|G0000000|G0000000|C1517001|C0040363|G0000000|C1260953|G0000000|C0220781|G0000000|G0000000|C0012771|C0332220|G0000000|C1547282|G0000000|G0000000|C0232117|C0002778|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1441547|G0000000|G0000000|C0750546|C1883254|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0445247|C0040223|C0080089|G0000000|G0000000|C0565930|C0185026|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0750489|C1511539|C0392747|C1709305|G0000000|G0000000|C0010834|G0000000|G0000000|C0444669|C0017446|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0725813|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0549177|C2603360|C0003320|G0000000|C0023376|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0007634|G0000000|G0000000|C0392747|C1705920|G0000000|C0150312|G0000000|G0000000|C0185117|G0000000|C1514798|C0032556|G0000000|G0000000|C0086418|C0030358|G0000000|G0000000|C0454802|C0007634|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205431|G0000000|C1704241|G0000000|C0023376|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1264633|G0000000|G0000000|C0443228|G0000000|G0000000|C1839839|G0000000|G0000000|C0012771|C1517892|C0040363|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0220781|G0000000|C0205393|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0439855|C0220781|G0000000|C0028778|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0185026|C0026882|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0302523|G0000000|C0332290|G0000000|G0000000|C0035820|G0000000|C0023376|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0185026|C1184743|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C1948023|C0205423|C1511539|C0392747|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000|C0205423|C0007634|C0033684|G0000000|C0965991|G0000000|G0000000|G0000000

B-cell lymphoma \( PMBL \) is a distinct subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \( DLBCL \) frequently observed in young patients High-dose immunochemotherapy constitutes the current therapeutic gold-standard , despite significant toxicity and serious late effects Several hotspots harboring oncogenic gain-of-function mutations were recently shown to pose vital hallmarks in activated B-cell like \( ABC- \) \( CD79B , CARD11 and MYD88 \) and germinal center like \( GCB- \) DLBCL \( EZH2 \) , respectively Several promising targeted-therapy approaches , derived from these findings , are currently under development We thoroughly characterized a cohort of 25 untreated patients with de novo PMBL by immunohistochemical and cytogenetic means and assessed the prevalence of activating mutations affecting EZH2 , CD79B and CARD11 utilizing a polymerase chain reaction \( PCR \) -based capillary sequencing approach Moreover , the MYD88 p L265P status was assessed by employing a pyrosequencing approach PMBLs included in this study did not harbor any of the reported hotspot mutations activating the nuclear factor \( NF \) -kappa B signaling cascade or the EZH2-mediated

mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma \( PMBL \) is a distinct subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \( DLBCL \) frequently observed in young patients High-dose immunochemotherapy constitutes the current therapeutic gold-standard , despite significant toxicity and serious late effects Several hotspots harboring oncogenic gain-of-function mutations were recently shown to pose vital hallmarks in activated B-cell like \( ABC- \) \( CD79B , CARD11 and MYD88 \) and germinal center like \( GCB- \) DLBCL \( EZH2 \) , respectively Several promising targeted-therapy approaches , derived from these findings , are currently under development We thoroughly characterized a cohort of 25 untreated patients with de novo PMBL by immunohistochemical and cytogenetic means and assessed the prevalence of activating mutations affecting EZH2 , CD79B and CARD11 utilizing a polymerase chain reaction \( PCR \) -based capillary sequencing approach Moreover , the MYD88 p L265P status was assessed by employing a pyrosequencing approach PMBLs included in this study did not harbor any of the reported hotspot mutations activating the nuclear factor \( NF \) -kappa B signaling cascade or the EZH2-mediated epigenetic deregulation of gene expression Immunohistochemical characterization revealed an ABC phenotype in 44 \( n 11 \) of cases We report that genetic alterations of these genes are

"1976007 19900901 A 15N-n m r study of cerebral , hepatic and renal nitrogen metabolism in hyperammonaemic rats 1 Rats were infused with 15NH4 or L- 15N alanine to induce hyperammonaemia , a potential cause of hepatic encephalopathy HClO4 extracts of freeze-clamped brain , liver and kidney were analysed by 15N-n m r spectroscopy in combination with biochemical assays to investigate the effects of hyperammonaemia on tissue concentrations of ammonia , glutamine , glutamate and urea 2 15NH4 infusion resulted in a 36-fold increase in the concentration of blood ammonia Cerebral glutamine concentration increased , with 15NH4 incorporated predominantly into the gamma-nitrogen atom of glutamine Incorporation into glutamate was very low Cerebral ammonia concentration increased 5-10-fold The results suggest that the capacity of glutamine synthetase for ammonia detoxification was saturated 3 Pretreatment with the glutamine synthetase inhibitor L-methionine DL-sulphoximine resulted in

other than glutamine synthetase , exists in rat brain 4 In the liver 15NH4 was incorporated into urea , glutamine , glutamate and alanine The specific activity of 15N was higher in the gamma-nitrogen

with biochemical assays to investigate the effects of hyperammonaemia on tissue concentrations of ammonia , glutamine , glutamate and urea 2 15NH4 infusion resulted in a 36-fold increase in the concentration of blood ammonia Cerebral glutamine concentration increased , with 15NH4 incorporated predominantly into the gamma-nitrogen atom of glutamine Incorporation into glutamate was very low Cerebral ammonia concentration increased 5-10-fold The results suggest that the capacity of glutamine synthetase for ammonia detoxification was saturated 3 Pretreatment with the glutamine synthetase

Survival Uracil N-glycosylase 2 \( UNG2 \) , the nuclear isoform of UNG , catalyzes the removal of uracil or 5-fluorouracil lesions that accumulate in DNA following treatment with the anticancer

"23233742 20121213 Admixture mapping of coronary artery calcified plaque in African Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus The presence and severity of coronary artery calcified plaque \( CAC \) differs markedly between individuals of African and European descent , suggesting that admixture mapping may be informative for identifying genetic variants associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease Admixture mapping of CAC was performed in 1040 unrelated African Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus from the African American-Diabetes Heart Study , Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Family Heart Study using the Illumina custom ancestry informative marker panel All cohorts obtained computed tomography scanning of the coronary arteries using identical protocols For each ancestry informative marker , the probability of inheriting 0 , 1 , and 2 copies of a European-derived allele was determined Linkage analysis was performed by testing for association between each ancestry informative marker using these probabilities and CAC , accounting for global ancestry , age , sex , and study Markers on 1p32 3 in the GLIS1 gene \( rs6663966 , logarithm of odds LOD 3 7 \) ,

"18075465 20071214 Promoter polymorphisms and allelic imbalance in ABCB1 expression The ABCB1 \( MDR1 \) gene , encoding the transporter P-glycoprotein , is known to act on a broad range of prescription medicines For this reason a large number of studies have assessed the functional consequences of variation in this gene Particular attention has focused on the ABCB1 3435C gt T polymorphism , an exonic variant resulting in a synonymous change This variant has been associated with mRNA , protein and serum levels , and with responses to a number of medicines The results of association studies have , however , been variable and it is not currently clear whether this polymorphism is functional or is in linkage disequilibrium with functionally distinct alleles To identify functional variation in the ABCB1 gene we assessed allelic imbalance by pyrosequencing cDNA from 80 lymphoblastoid B cell lines from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain \( CEPH \) collection , including 74 individuals heterozygous for 3435C gt T We found that the degree of ABCB1 allelic imbalance differed among B-cell lines In an effort to fine-map variants that influence the proportion of the two allelic mRNA species we genotyped representative common variations near the 3435C gt T polymorphism by using a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism \( SNP \) approach In one approach , we assessed in segregating families the impact of cis-acting variants on mRNA levels by using allelic imbalance as the phenotype in a regression analysis that distinguishes the coupling arrangements \( phase \) among alleles In a second approach , we assessed allelic imbalance levels in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines from unrelated HapMap individuals , and performed an association using tagSNPs in a 5-Mb region surrounding the gene Two potential cis-acting variants , a promoter rs28656907 rs28373093 dinucleotide polymorphism \( P 0 007 \) and the rs10245483 SNP \( P 0 0003 \) located 2 Mb upstream from the gene , were predictors of ABCB1 expression The study outlines a general experimental approach for fine mapping gene variants that influence mRNA expression by using cultured cell

most of which have not been analyzed for TE content previously The results showed that TE diversity varies widely across the fungi quot kingdom quot and appears to positively correlate with genome

binding and in blocking the BK-induced IP production by the non-peptide antagonists LF16-0687 and FR173657 at the wild type and mutant receptors were analysed While the affinities of LF16-0687 and FR173657 were crucially decreased at the I110A , Y295A , and Y295F mutants , the W256A mutation affected the affinity of the LF16-0687 only The important contribution of the quinoline moiety was shown by the inability of an analogue of LF16-0687 , lacking this moiety , to affect BK binding at the wild type receptor On the other hand , the benzamidine group did not interact with mutated residues , since LF16-0687 analogues without this group or with an oxidated benzamidine displayed pairwise loss of affinity on wild type and mutated receptors Further differences between FR173657 and LF16-0687 were highlighted at the I110 and Y295 mutants when comparing binding \( pK \( i \) \) and functional antagonist \( pKB \) affinity First , the I110A mutation similarly impaired their binding affinity \( 250-fold \) , but at a less extent the antagonist potency of FR173657 only Second , both the hydroxyl and the phenyl moieties of the Y295 residue had a specific role in the LF16-0687 interaction with the receptor , as demonstrated at the Y295F and Y295A mutants , respectively , but not in that of FR173657 Present data identify a receptor binding pocket comprised among TM3 , 6 , and 7 , which concerns the interaction of the non-peptide antagonists FR173657 and LF16-0687 , but not that of the peptide agonist or antagonist Results indicate the quinoline group as the involved pharmacophoric element , and that the studied residues are differently involved in the interaction The analysis performed by means of the GRID software led us to propose different spatial orientations of the quinoline moieties and partially overlapping binding pockets for the two ligands that of LF16-0687 is located in the lipophilic environment amongst I110 \( TM3 \) , W256 \( TM6 \) , and Y295 \( TM7 \)

ligands the agonist BK and the peptide antagonist MEN 11270 The affinities in competing for 3H -BK binding and in blocking the BK-induced IP production by the non-peptide antagonists LF16-0687 and FR173657 at the wild type and mutant receptors were analysed While the affinities of LF16-0687 and FR173657 were crucially decreased at the I110A , Y295A , and Y295F mutants , the W256A mutation affected the affinity of the LF16-0687 only The important contribution of the quinoline moiety was shown by the inability of an analogue of LF16-0687 , lacking this moiety , to affect BK binding at the wild type receptor On the other hand , the benzamidine group did not interact with mutated residues , since LF16-0687 analogues without this group or with an oxidated benzamidine displayed pairwise loss of affinity on wild type and mutated receptors Further differences between FR173657 and LF16-0687 were highlighted at the I110 and Y295 mutants when comparing binding \( pK \( i \) \) and functional antagonist \( pKB \) affinity First , the I110A mutation similarly impaired their binding affinity \( 250-fold \) , but at a less extent the antagonist potency of FR173657 only Second , both the hydroxyl and the phenyl moieties of the Y295 residue had a specific role in the LF16-0687 interaction with the receptor , as demonstrated at the Y295F and Y295A mutants , respectively , but not in that of FR173657 Present data identify a receptor binding pocket comprised among TM3 , 6 , and 7 , which concerns the interaction of the non-peptide antagonists FR173657 and LF16-0687 , but not that of the peptide agonist or antagonist Results indicate the quinoline group as the involved pharmacophoric element , and that the studied residues are differently involved in the interaction The analysis performed by means of the GRID software led us to propose different spatial orientations of the quinoline moieties and partially overlapping binding pockets for the two ligands that of LF16-0687 is located in the lipophilic environment amongst I110 \( TM3 \) , W256 \( TM6 \) , and Y295 \( TM7 \) residues , whereas that of FR173657 lies essentially between I110 and Y295 Biochem

"23642306 20130507 Using a new odour-baited device to explore options for luring and killing outdoor-biting malaria vectors a report on design and field evaluation of the Mosquito Landing Box Mosquitoes that bite people outdoors can sustain malaria transmission even where effective indoor interventions such as bednets or indoor residual spraying are already widely used Outdoor tools may therefore complement current indoor measures and improve control We developed and evaluated a prototype mosquito control device , the 'Mosquito Landing Box' \( MLB \) , which is baited with human odours and treated with mosquitocidal agents The findings are used to explore technical options and challenges relevant to luring and killing outdoor-biting malaria vectors in endemic settings Field experiments were conducted in Tanzania to assess if wild host-seeking mosquitoes 1 \) visited the MLBs , 2 \) stayed long or left shortly after arrival at the device , 3 \) visited the devices at times when humans were also outdoors , and 4 \) could be killed by contaminants applied on the devices Odours suctioned from volunteer-occupied tents were also evaluated as a potential low-cost bait , by comparing baited and unbaited MLBs There were significantly more Anopheles arabiensis , An funestus , Culex and Mansonia mosquitoes visiting baited MLB than unbaited controls \( P \? 0 028 \) Increasing sampling frequency from every 120 min to 60 and 30 min led to an increase in vector catches of up to 3 6 fold \( P \? 0 002 \) , indicating that many mosquitoes visited the device but left shortly afterwards Outdoor host-seeking activity of malaria vectors peaked between 7 30 and 10 30 pm , and between 4 30 and 6 00 am , matching durations when locals were also outdoors Maximum mortality of mosquitoes visiting MLBs sprayed or painted with formulations of candidate mosquitocidal agent \( pirimiphos-methyl \) was 51 Odours from volunteer occupied tents attracted significantly more mosquitoes to MLBs than controls \( P lt 0 001 \) While odour-baited devices such as the MLBs clearly have potential against outdoor-biting mosquitoes in communities where LLINs are used , candidate contaminants must be those that are effective at ultra-low doses even after short contact periods , since important vector species such as An arabiensis make only brief visits to such devices Natural human odours suctioned from occupied dwellings could constitute affordable sources of attractants to supplement odour baits for the devices The killing agents used should be environmentally safe , long lasting , and have different modes of action \( other than pyrethroids as used on LLINs \) , to curb the risk of physiological insecticide resistance Parasit Vectors
